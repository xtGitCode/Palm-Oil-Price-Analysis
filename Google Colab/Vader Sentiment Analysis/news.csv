29/08/2022,"29/08/2022 (English News China), Jakarta – Indonesia has extended its zero-levy policy for palm oil exports until October 31, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs said on Monday.
""The extension of the export levy tariff of 0 U.S. dollar will maintain the current momentum where the prices of crude palm oil and domestic cooking oil have stabilized, and the price of fresh fruit bunches has increased so that farmers could enjoy the benefits,"" said Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto.
Indonesian palm oil producers have struggled with high stockpiles after the country imposed a three-week export ban from April 28 to May 23 to reduce domestic cooking oil prices.
The temporary policy of cutting the palm oil export levy to zero from around 200 U.S. dollars per ton was introduced by the world's largest palm oil producer in July, to boost exports and reduce oversupply in the domestic market. - Xinhua

29/08/2022,"29/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Jakarta - Palm oil advanced after Indonesia, the world’s biggest grower, raised its export tax for the first half of September and announced an increased allocation for local biodiesel use this year.
Futures for November delivery rose as much as 2.3% to RM4,266 (US$951) a tonne before closing at RM4,176. Soybean oil, palm’s closest substitute, retreated, while Brent crude climbed for a second day on supply concerns.
Indonesia raised the export tax to US$124 a tonne, up from US$74 for the last two weeks of August, said Musdhalifah Machmud, deputy for food and agriculture at the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs. It increased the crude palm oil reference price for Sept 1 to 15 to US$930.02 a tonne.
The higher export tax is supportive for palm, as it gives scope for Malaysian prices to rise as well, said Sathia Varqa, owner of Palm Oil Analytics in Singapore.
However, the gains will likely be short-lived as there’s a lack of bullish drivers, he added.
Indonesia also announced a target to lift palm-based biodiesel use to 11.03 million kiloliters, from 10.15 million kiloliters previously. The government said the increase is needed to maintain its B30 mandate, as diesel consumption will rise in the fourth quarter as the economy recovers.
The move by Indonesia aided palm prices in Kuala Lumpur, said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, head of trading and hedging strategies at Kaleesuwari Intercontinental. Investors are also waiting for Malaysian August export data due this week, with shipments likely to climb 5% to 10% or even more, he said.

29/08/2022,"29/08/2022 (Malay Mail), Kota Kinabalu - Medium-sized oil palm producers in the state will soon adopt sustainable practices under the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification standards.
This comes after the first meeting of the Koperasi Lestari Penanam Sawit Sabah Berhad (Klass), a cooperative to assist the producers get group accreditation under the two certification standards.
“Businesses are often discouraged from pursuing certification as it is costly. The newly formed cooperative will serve as a platform to support its members’ certifications by sharing costs and applying industry best practices to achieve group certification under MSPO and RSPO standards,” said Koperasi Klass protem chairman Hamka Kasma.
According to a statement issued by WWF-Malaysia, the certification was a joint application by a group of oil palm growers and will apply to them all.
In order to facilitate access for small producers and offer reduced costs, a group certification model allows each individual group member to benefit from the economies of scale by being part of a larger group, as well as making certification more affordable as costs are shared.
Both certification standards, among others, require oil palm plantations to preserve riparian reserves, avoid development on steep slopes and prevent encroachment on protected areas.
“Good agricultural practices and respecting human rights are also required towards stopping deforestation and ensuring no exploitation of people in the production of sustainable palm oil,” said the statement.
Klass is the third cooperative facilitated by WWF-Malaysia’s Sustainable Palm Oil Team (SPOT) after the formation of Koperasi Pekebun Kecil dan Sederhana Sawit Lestari Sabah Berhad (KO-Salesa) this August.
Currently, both Klass and KO-Salesa consist of 50 and 37 smallholders, respectively, covering a combined total land area of roughly 1,300 hectares in the Tabin and Sandakan landscapes.
The first initiative is Koperasi Landskap Kelapa Sawit Sabah Bhd (LKSS) facilitated by SPOT in 2019 for Tawau which now has over 380 members comprising of 300 smallholders and 80 medium-sized growers with a cumulative land area of about 16,000 hectares.
Of 380 growers from LKSS who are part of the group certification, 25 are undergoing RSPO certification processes.
WWF-Malaysia’s Head of Conservation Robecca Jumin said that they were hoping to improve sustainable oil palm production that will directly impact conservation efforts on Sabah’s forests and the restoration of its key ecological corridors, ultimately creating a living landscape.
WWF-Malaysia’s sustainable agriculture manager Max Donysius said that the MSPO certification was a necessary step towards RSPO certification, and in line with the state government’s commitment to 30 per cent Totally Protected Areas (TPA) and 100 per cent RSPO certification of palm oil by 2025.
Under WWF-Malaysia’s Sabah Landscapes Programme, SPOT aims to support 450 small and medium-sized growers in three priority landscapes, namely Tawau-Kunak, Tabin and Lower Sugut, covering 45,000 hectares to produce RSPO-certified palm oil by 2025.
Based on the three pillars of “Protect, Produce, Restore,” the Sabah Landscapes Programme combines both conservation and sustainable development by integrating the protection of forests, wildlife and rivers, with RSPO-certified production of oil palm, and restoration of ecological corridors and riparian reserves.

29/08/2022,"29/08/2022 (Borneo Post Online), Kuching - Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd’s (Sarawak Oil Palms) minimal forward position was a main factor behind its stellar profit in the first half of 2022 (1H22), which analysts believe enabled it to benefit from higher crude palm oil (CPO) spot prices.
“The main culprit – the labour shortage – has not improved much, and remains at 30 to 35 per cent levels.”
RHB Research gathered that Sarawak Oil Palms partly alleviates this issue by reallocating more workers to high-yield areas, as well as hiring contract workers for maintenance and upkeep work.
“Management believes this shortage will only be resolved by end-2H22.
“However, if this is prolonged and the influx of workers gets delayed, the company may again not be able to fully benefit from the peak season.”
That said, the research firm made no changes to its FFB growth, on the assumption that output will pick up in 2H.
Meanwhile, RHB Research opined that the group will face challenging quarters ahead for downstream segment.
Although no disclosures were given, the research firm believed downstream margins remained stable, given the high utilisation at around 80 per cent.
“However, margin compression may be likely in an environment of falling prices, given the higher cost of feedstock bought (this is processed one to two months later, at lower prices).
“We remain optimistic on this segment, as Sarawak Oil Palms’ downstream expansion is set to be completed in 2H22 – where the focus is on producing higher-quality, tailored refined products for customers.”

29/08/2022,"29/08/2022 (Successful Farming) - Indonesia has raised its 2022 biodiesel allocation to 11.03 million kilolitres amid expectations of rising demand in the fourth quarter while it extends an export levy waiver to maintain price stability, a senior minister said on Monday.
The allocation of biodiesel, which is made from palm oil in Indonesia, will be increased from 10.15 million kilolitres, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said in a statement.
Indonesia has a mandatory B30 programme, where 30% of the fuel is palm-oil based, and post-pandemic economic recovery is boosting demand for the fuel, he said.
The world's top palm oil producer has also decided to extend its export levy waiver until Oct. 31, Airlangga added.
""The extension of $0 levy is intended to maintain the current momentum, where the price of crude palm oil is starting to stabilise, the price of cooking oil starts to fall, and the price of fresh fruit bunches begins to rise,"" he said.
The world's top palm oil exporter has waived palm oil export levy since mid-July to encourage export of the edible oil amid a build-up of domestic stock caused by an export ban in May that was imposed to control cooking oil prices. The finance ministry regulation detailing the levy waiver extension has not yet been made public. - Reuters

g 2022,"27 Aug 2022, KUALA LUMPUR: The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives is expected to experience technical correction next week, as concerns over production and inventory will weigh on investors’ appetite.
  Interband Group of Companies senior palm oil trader Jim Teh said the current high supply in palm oil producing countries might continue to hurt CPO prices next week, which will likely range between RM3,400 and RM3,600 a tonne.
  ""The market will move in a yo-yo mode as investors are cautious. There are high inventories in producing countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia following good weather, and this will influence trading,” he told Bernama.
  Commenting on the extension of Indonesia’s palm oil export levy waiver to Oct 31, Teh said the new policy would continue to weigh on the local market as the cheaper prices offered by Indonesia would definitely woo more buyers.
This included potential demand from India ahead of a series of Hindu festivals lined up over the next two months starting with Ganesh Chaturthi, Navaratri, Dussehra, and the biggest festival in the country, Deepavali.
  ""Price-wise, we may be losing to Indonesia. However, our ports efficiency that is better than Indonesia will provide us some advantages,” he said, citing forex speculative play by traders and the movement of ringgit versus the US dollar would also weigh on buying next week.
  For the week-just-ended, Malaysian CPO futures started the week on a firm note mostly influenced by the bullish soybean market. Trend started to decline Thursday onwards due to concerns over inventory.
On Wednesday, the Malaysian Palm Oil Association announced that Malaysia’s CPO production for August 1-20 rose 16.18 per cent month-on-month, with production in Peninsular Malaysia increasing by 11.87 per cent, Sabah (+33.36 per cent) and Sarawak (+4.66 per cent).
  On a Friday-to-Friday basis, the CPO futures contract for spot month September 2022 increased by RM59 to RM4,149 a tonne, October 2022 advanced RM73 to RM4,174 a tonne, November 2022 was RM79 higher at RM4,172 a tonne, and December 2022 surged RM178 to RM4,281 a tonne.
  Meanwhile, January 2023 rose RM87 to RM4,219 a tonne and February 2023 soared RM152 to RM4,333 a tonne.
  Total volume expanded to 304,049 lots from 278,307 lots in the previous week, while open interest narrowed to 181,420 contracts from 183,505 contracts previously.

g 2022,"29 Aug 2022- The ban of crude palm oil and its derivatives exports by Indonesia, the world’s largest supplier of the commodity, should be music to the ears of investors in that line of business in Nigeria who eye the export market. Before the ban, palm oil and the refined products from it, were a major source of foreign earnings for that Asian country. In April 2020, a ton of Indonesian crude palm oil was fetching around $545 on the European and other markets. Two years later, that jumped to $1,700.
For most agricultural experts, it is painful to recall that the Asians picked the first seedlings of the agricultural plant from Nigeria in the first republic. Ironically, Indonesia has eclipsed Nigeria in the cultivation of the plant and the production of its derivatives no thanks to a policy that played down the importance of agriculture in the nation’s strive to increase its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and enhance her foreign revenue earnings.
The reference to the above analysis is intended to bring to the fore the vision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which is pursuing a policy of reviving the oil palm arm of the agro-business sector in Nigeria. It is obvious that the demand for palm oil in the global market is healthy enough to encourage any businessman desirous of investing in the sector that has proved to be even more profitable than oil and gas. It is on record that, presently, a barrel of palm oil costs more than a barrel of crude.
It goes without saying that oil palm business is sustainable in the long run because it is renewable unlike hydrocarbon which is a wasting asset. It is from this perspective that the present administration in CBN took the bull by the horn as part of its effort to return agriculture to its pride of place as a major economic activity that once buoyed the economy of the country. It is also important that the CBN chose oil palm as one of the crops to attract its policy intervention. It is pertinent to point out that in the immediate post-independent Nigeria, oil palm played a key role in the economy of the then Eastern Region.
It is pertinent to observe that Oil Palm supply gap is estimated at 1,250,000 metric tonnes. This is even as local demand is estimated at 2,500,000 metric tonnes and local production is 1,250,000 metric tonnes. It is, therefore, germane to point out why the apex bank is so committed to bringing back the lost glory of the sector that financed the major infrastructure in the south, especially, the South east in the colonial and immediate post-colonial era in the country.
CBN’s intervention in the Oil Palm value chain, pragmatic as it is forward looking, is aimed at increasing production from 1,250,000 metric tonnes to 2,500,000 metric tonnes by 2028 through the cultivation of approximately 350,000 hectares. The overall policy objective is to meet local demand for palm oil and its derivatives and at the same time improve local processing quality and standards; conserve foreign exchange reserves; create jobs and enhance the skills of Nigerian people along the oil palm value chain; facilitate easier access to funding for palm oil majors, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and smallholders in a way that will improve and grow the economy. 
Information available in the economic space indicate that the key value chain development activities in the sector which the CBN is deliberately pursuing involves the funding of oil palm majors and SMEs towards plantation development and mill construction and upgrade.
It also includes a policy thrust to develop the out-growers framework for implementation, pursue a pilot scheme of the out growers’ scheme and facilitate land allocation to investors by state governments. It is instructive to point out that there are ongoing discussions between moribund oil palm estates such as Adapalm in the South east and possible investors. So far 170,000 hectares of land has been allocated to investors across 11 States.
For instance, the Edo State Oil Palm Program (ESOPP) launched by Godwin Emefiele in 2019 is expanding. So far, a total of 65,000 hectares have been allocated by the state government to oil palm investors while the CBN has provided funding for the projects in the State to the tune of N51.29 billion. On its part, the Ondo state government has flagged-off its Red Gold Project. The state allocated a total of 54,000 hectares to oil palm companies and is supporting smallholder farmers towards the cultivation of a total of 6,000 hectares across three senatorial districts, in phases. The support is in form of providing ISPO, a government certification scheme issued through a ministerial regulation and as such is legally binding. The farmers have commenced nursery development, part of which commenced last year and will be transplanted to the main fields this year.
Other states are also having talks with CBN through their Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) towards accessing facility for oil palm development by small holder farmers. Already, industry watchers are mapping out plans, projections and forecasts for 2022 and beyond with the hope that 350,000 hectares will be cultivated by 2028 as expected. In the final analysis and within the period under review, that is to say, total approved disbursement to Oil Palm Major/SME/Smallholders by CBN from inception of the policy to April 2022, is put at N73.38 billion. This is immensely commendable.
It is also necessary to point out that events in Indonesia is positive pointer to the appropriateness of the Emefiele policy in the oil palm sector. From this perspective, therefore, experts urge investors in Nigeria to redouble their efforts so as to take advantage of the openings created by that country in the international palm oil market.
The benefits are immeasurable as no bi-product of oil palm is wasted. Apart from palm oil, there is palm kernel and, yes, brooms that are still heavily in use in spite of the onslaught of technology. A new broom as it is said sweeps clean even in politics.

g 2022,"29 Aug 2022, New Delhi [India], (ANI): Edible oil industry body The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA) has requested Indonesia to maintain stable export duties and levies besides trade policies related to palm oil to ensure less speculation on what stance the government might take.
Earlier this month, Indonesian Embassy in New Delhi organized an Indonesia-India Roundtable Business Engagement where the Indonesian side was headed by trade minister Zulkifli Hasan. The roundtable was followed by a special meeting with a delegation of the edible oil industry body SEA to discuss various matters pertaining to, how to step up export of crude palm oil from Indonesia to India.
India is a large importer of edible oils, and a sizable part of it comes from Indonesia.
“We advised trade minister that with prices coming down and better supply from Indonesia, import of palm oil should increase in coming days and Indonesia should ensure a stable policy for exports,” SEA said in a statement.
SEA President Atul Chaturvedi-led delegation discussed extensively on how a ban on palm oil exports has caused supply chain issues in India and also “put a dent” on the Indonesian policy decision making by which they have apparently lost their market share to other palm oil producing nation and how the commodity lost the market share to soft oils.
“Indonesian Trade minister took the feedback positively and ensured that there won’t be any such supply crunch from Indonesia,” the statement said.
They also touched upon the topic on how a difference in export tax and levy on refined products against crude variants may give an advantage to refined products as India is one of the largest consumers and has a lot of refining capacity and any advantage given to refined products at origins makes refining unviable in India which the industry body is not sustainable on longer-term as this might give advantage to soft oils where refining capacity can be utilized and refiners can make some margins.
Further, the delegation delved upon Indonesia’s biofuel mandate and suggested it was “not good to burn the edible oil when there are still some developing and underdeveloped countries fighting with hunger and poverty,” the statement added.
To this observation, Indonesia said it understands the situation but they need to counter the imports of biofuels in the country and ensure that their farmers get better realization and hence they have started the trials.
“However he has not given any clear picture whether they’ll surely go for B-40,” the statement added. B-40 means the mixing of as much as 40 per cent biofuel in the transport fuels.
Lastly, the SEA delegated requested the Indonesian trade minister to form a Palm Promotion Council jointly with SEA so that they together can try to change the negative image of palm oil and further suggested earmarking some fund for the promotion, to which the statement said the minister “positively responded and agreed to look into this suggestion.”
Palm oil is still viewed as “poor man’s oil” in India and perceived as unhealthy oil and that’s the sole reason that palm oil is not consumed widely in households and primarily used for out of home consumption, the edible oil body explained their rationale behind the proposal to from a promotion council.

g 2022,"26 Aug 2022- Coffee is the country’s second-largest agricultural commodity after palm oil, accounting for 27 percent of all agriculture exports and six percent of the country’s GDP.
Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea James Marape has announced an inaugural minister for coffee, in what is believed to be the world's first.
The post shows the government's commitment to expanding key agriculture industries, said Marape on Tuesday, who won re-election earlier this month after an election plagued by violence and allegations of voter fraud.
""Minister Kuli’s focus will be coffee, coffee, and coffee,"" he said, announcing the appointment of Joe Kuli, from Anglimp-South Waghi.
The coffee industry needed to be revived to bring in more export revenue, Marape said. 
He added that Kuli understood the challenge because he comes from the Wahgi Valley of Jiwaka, which was once a huge coffee plantation, but has been overgrown by bush.
Coffee is the country’s second-largest agricultural commodity after palm oil, accounting for 27 percent of all agriculture exports and 6 percent of the country’s GDP, The Guardian reported.
Minister for palm oil
For the first time Marape also named a minister for palm oil.
The coffee and palm oil ministries sit alongside the main agriculture ministry, run by Goroka MP Aiye Tambua.
""The appointments specifically spotlight agriculture in a very significant way, to see agriculture growth in the country,"" he said when announcing the new 33-member cabinet.
""I want to drink coffee made in Goroka, Mt Hagen, Lae and other parts of the country. I want to see more coffee grown for export to the lucrative markets of the world,"" he added.

25/08/2022,"As palm oil’s presence in Indian diets has grown, so has conflicting information over its health effects compared to other vegetable oils. Seema Prasad investigates
25/08/2022 (China Dialogue) - Palm oil is now ubiquitous. Arguably the world’s most versatile oil, it is used as a preservative in a variety of foods and has a host of other applications in shampoos, cosmetics and even biofuels. Its prevalence is explained in part by the higher oil content of the palm fruit compared to other oil crops.
As the oil’s consumption has become more widespread in India, so has the debate over its health implications. The discussion centres on its high saturated fat content but includes conflicting information and, quite frequently, interest-driven claims. Here we weigh up some of these concerns and the conversations around them.
Booming demand for palm oil in India
India is the world’s second-largest consumer of palm oil, with consumption having soared during the 2000s to reach around 9 million tonnes each year. Palm oil now accounts for about 40% of India’s edible oil consumption. 
The nation is almost entirely dependent on imports to meet this demand, becoming the world’s largest importer. Incomings grew from below 500,000 tonnes in 1994 to a peak of 10 million tonnes in 2018. Most of this arrives in crude form to be refined domestically, while about 30% comes already refined.
Palm oil was not much used in Indian cooking until its import was liberalised near the turn of the century. “As India opened up in the 1990s, it was attractive to import cheap palm oil to meet our needs, especially as a lack of investment in the local oilseed sector had led to its decline,” explains Bhavani Shankar, a professorial research fellow in food and health at the University of Sheffield. “The major exporters, Indonesia and Malaysia, were also strongly promoting their palm oil to new markets like India.”
In 2021, the Indian government launched the National Mission on Edible Oils to promote domestic oil palm cultivation, focusing on the northeast region and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. The goal was to reduce dependence on edible oil imports significantly.
Dr R Hemalatha, director of the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN), explains that oil palm’s superior productivity makes its oil the cheapest around. “Accordingly, our country is also promoting the acreage for palm plantations to enhance vegetable oil production and reduce imports.”
Because of its low price, palm oil is popular for household cooking among India’s poorer citizens. As of 2019, about 10.2% of India’s population lived in extreme poverty on less than US$1.90 per person each day. At 30 to 100 Indian rupees (US$0.40–$1.30), branded palm oil in India is cheaper per litre than other edible oils.
“One 15 kg tin of palm oil costs 2,550 rupees [US$32], whereas the same quantity of sunflower oil costs about 2,990 [US$38] and soybean costs around 2,700 [US$34],” says Sagar Nandagudi, CEO of Nandagudi Oils and Agro Industries, a company based in Karnataka that refines and sells palm oil to wholesalers.
Professor Shankar says other oils may not ever be as cheap, but when palm oil’s health and environmental implications are taken into account, there is a compelling argument for having a range of oils in the food system.
“Such diversification is also good for resilience against shocks,” Shankar adds. “We are seeing the fallout of the Ukraine war resulting in soaring sunflower oil, and consequently, palm oil prices, which are suddenly making it much less affordable. If we have a diversity of oils thriving in the system, the shock to a particular oil is cushioned.”
Dietary debates: Palm oil, red palm oil and vitamin A
In India, palm oil has often been touted as the cure-all food for vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A can help maintain vision, strengthen the immune system and support bone health. Deficiency in it is common in developing countries and among preschool children in India. In its severe form, it can lead to stunted growth and blindness.
Carotenoids are pigments that gives plants, fruits and vegetables bright colouring. One such, beta-carotene, the body can convert into vitamin A. In its unprocessed form, crude palm oil derived from the flesh of the fruit contains 500–700 parts per million of carotenes. But carotenoids are removed from palm oil during the conventional refining process.
Red palm oil, by contrast, is a less heavily processed version that retains 70% to 90% of the beta-carotene content. Palm oil refiners say it is not marketable, as the red colour may be less appealing to consumers, given its association with food additives.
It has “not taken off for commercial sale” explains Manorama Kamireddy, former principal scientist at the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research.
Unlike India, Malaysia has two major brands that produce red palm oil. They are Carotino, a mix of red palm oil and canola, and Harvist, which is 100% red palm oil, according to Rachel Tan Choon Hui, a professor in applied sciences at UCSI University Kuala Lumpur. She authored a recent review on improved refining processes for palm oil and supports the notion that red palm oil is a better option to counter vitamin A deficiency. She echoes references to red palm oil’s “mild” processing and its retention of carotenoids.
BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) of India, an organisation that represents the edible oil industry, expands on why the market remains small. “There is a lack of awareness among consumers about the beta-carotene content in red palm oil and its other health advantages,” Mehta explains. “For example, everyone knows about the health benefits of olive oil in India, and people are willing to pay for it. It’s about three things: awareness, affordability and marketing. That’s the only difference.”
Palm oil, cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases
A range of conflicting information has spread, both in India and beyond, on the implications of palm oil consumption for cardiovascular health, much of it providing few citations or authoritative sources. By some accounts, palm oil can cause heart disease; by others, it reverses heart disease. Many report that palm oil consumption increases cholesterol levels, while others say it does not. Such fervent debate is not likely to be settled swiftly, but a closer look at what palm oil consists of can be instructive.
Kamireddy says that some fatty acids contained in palm oil, such as oleic acid and linoleic acid “are not harmful and protect from developing cardiovascular diseases”. But, she says, palm oil offers no benefit over and above other commonly used vegetable oils in preventing cardiovascular disease.
Dr Hemalatha echoes this, but says palm oil is no better than other types of vegetable oils regarding cholesterol. She mentions a 2019 analysis of several trials, conducted between 1975 and 2018, which showed that palm oil consumption did not alter cholesterol levels much more than other vegetable oils.
However, according to a 2015 American Society for Nutrition study, despite the presence of potentially beneficial acids, palm oil’s high saturated fat content means that, overall, its consumption can contribute to a higher cholesterol level, and thus raise the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The society advises reductions in palm oil use in favour of other oils lower in saturated fats.
A 2016 study conducted by the Institute of Home Economics at the University of Delhi and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, compared the saturated fat content of various edible oils, demonstrating the higher presence in palm oil of long-chain saturated fatty acids; these acids, such as palmitic acid and stearic acid, are known to contribute more to cardiovascular inflammation and fat storage than other saturated fats.
The study’s authors recommend moving away from dependence on palm oil towards a mixture of edible oils in the diet, and even blending oils in cooking. Most experts consulted echoed this conclusion, with many underlining the importance of increasing the diversity of oils consumed. “Since complete dependence on a single vegetable oil may not provide the optimal balance of all the fatty acids, ICMR-NIN recommends consuming a variety of vegetable oils, including palm oil,” Hemalatha said.
Vitally, experts say, all oils should be consumed as part of a balanced, healthy diet and lifestyle.

25/08/2022,"25/08/2022 (CBNC TV) - Malaysian ringgit ebbed to the lowest levels in five years against the dollar last week. As a result, it is set to pull down palm oil prices further aiding India’s fight against inflation. The Malaysian currency plunged to 4.4810 against the greenback on Friday — a level last seen in January 2017. On Thursday, ringgit fell to 4.47 vs the US dollar — last seen during the Asian financial crisis in early 1998.
The weakness in the ringgit has followed the wider currency and foreign fund outflow trends ($1.82 billion in Malaysia’s case until August 18) in other major economies, including India, as the US Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher to tame inflation amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions.
Why it matters?
A weaker ringgit makes Malaysian palm oil more attractive for buyers, reflected in Malaysia's benchmark palm oil futures, which rose for a third straight session on Tuesday, August 23.
Overall, edible oil prices have been volatile this year, facing a double whammy of sorts. First, the war in Ukraine pushed sunflower prices higher on short supply, and secondly, the world’s largest palm oil producer Indonesia imposed a ban on palm oil exports in April (subsequently clarifying the policy prohibited only refined palm oil exports, and later lifted it in May).
Among edible oils, palm oil accounts for around 40 percent of the global supply with Indonesia and Malaysia accounting for more than three-fourths of it.
After a strong rally owing to the above factors, palm oil prices fell to multi-month lows amid rising production in the face of low export demand. In fact, both Indonesia and Malaysia have either reduced or removed duties to promote palm oil exports to help local producers now.
The Malay government has kept its export tax for crude palm oil at 8 percent, ensuring that Malaysian palm oil prices are about the same level as Indonesia's. The latter has also suspended its export levy until October end and eased regulations for local palm producers.
The big picture and India’s “imported” inflation
India is among the top two consumers along with China of edible oils. Palm oil accounts for more than half of India’s edible oil import basket. A sharp jump in prices of commodities used to produce edible oils owing to the fallout of global supply disruptions pushed India’s retail inflation to an eight-year high of 7.79 percent, much above the 4 (+/-2) percent tolerance zone of the Reserve Bank of India.
The country benefitted from the low average year-on-year inflation in vegetable oils between 2014 and 2020 at around -5.79 percent, which spiked to more than 33 percent in the last two years, as per an article in The Centre For Policy Research
The headline retail inflation, however, has eased to 6.7 percent in July 2022 on the back of a decline in food inflation.
""The declining global prices of edible oils and the government's measures to reduce domestic prices of these commodities have had a profound impact on tempering India's retail food inflation,"" the finance ministry said in its Monthly Economic Review released on Friday.
Experts suggest that in the short-term prices may remain bearish but the overall long-term outlook remains firm.
“With strength in the Ringgit and easing labour issues in Malaysia, palm oil production is expected to rise this year. Indonesia also extended the export levy waiver until October 31.  Global edible oil prices corrected from record highs in the last two months. However, the higher energy prices and demand from the EU and China are supporting prices at lower levels. Looking to the fundamentals, edible oil prices will remain soft for next one to two months but increased demand during the festival season could continue to support prices,” Manoj Kumar Jain, Director-Head of Commodity Research, Prithvi Finmart told CNBC-TV18.com.
Ajay Kedia, Founder and Director, Kedia Advisory said that prices may consolidate around current levels.
""The prices in September are expected to be slightly weaker due to lower crude oil prices, easing supply chain situation, especially vis-a-vis soybean and edible oil stocks from the Black Sea area. But prices may consolidate as Q3 coincides with the festive season and it is usually a strong season,"" Kedia told CNBC-TV18.com.

25/08/2022,"25/08/2022 (Antara News), Pekanbaru - Vice President Ma'ruf Amin planted top-quality hybrid oil palm sprouts with 100 santris (students) from the Riau Technology Islamic Boarding School (Pesantren) on Sumatra Highway, Siak Hulu, Kampar district, Riau, on Thursday.
""Today, I am grateful to witness the planting of oil palm tree sprouts by the santris. Also, I have obtained various information on the development of oil palm and the discovery of quality seeds,"" Amin remarked. He was accompanied by Riau Governor Syamsuar and other officials.
The Vice President said that he felt proud of the collaboration among the Indonesian Palm Oil Farmer Association (Apkasindo), the local government, and palm oil companies for the oil palm-based santripreneur program.
He also expressed the hope that Islamic boarding schools would not only become centers of Islamic education, but also centers of economic empowerment, especially related to the financial, real, and production sectors.
""I think this collaboration is very good and it involves students,"" he remarked.

26/08/2022,"26/08/2022 (The Edge Markets) - Oriental Holdings Bhd’s net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022 (2QFY22) jumped by nearly four times to RM136.81 million or 22.05 sen per share from RM34.93 million or 5.63 sen per share a year ago, on higher share profit of its associates.
The group's share of profit after tax of equity accounted associates ballooned to RM21.48 million from RM115,000, its bourse filings showed.
The better quarterly performance was also lifted by foreign currency exchange gains of RM6.71 million against a loss of RM8.02 million in 2QFY21. 
Quarterly revenue rose 23.08% to RM939.18 million from RM763.1 million the year before.
The group has proposed a dividend of 20 sen per share. This will bring its year-to-date dividend payout to 30 sen per share, 16 sen higher than what it paid last year.
For the cumulative six-month period ended June 30, Oriental's net profit more than doubled to RM404.65 million from RM156.98 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 13.65% to RM1.88 billion from RM1.65 billion.
Oriental said the improved six-month profitability was mainly due to higher contributions from hotels and resorts and plantation segments.
The increase in revenue, meanwhile, was attributed to higher contribution from the plantation, investment properties and trading of building material products segments, on overall increase in crude palm oil prices (CPO) and palm kernel selling prices and higher sales volume from building material products respectively.
On prospects, the group said its automotive segment will continue to contribute to its performance under very competitive market conditions with strong and aggressive promotional campaigns by the industry players.
However, it warned that shortage of vital components such as semiconductor chips continues to be a concern for certain models as the war in Ukraine continues to put a strain on supplies of important parts needed.
Turning to its plastic segment, Oriental said the segment continues to face competition from other industry players and disruptions in the global supply chain and limited growth in the local automotive industry. Hence, management will continue to exercise cost rationalisation, productivity improvement and source for new business ventures to improve the performance of the segment.
For the plantation segment, despite the removal of Indonesia’s three-week CPO export ban, Oeiental noted that Indonesia's exports have not reverted to normal levels as Jakarta required companies to sell a portion of output at home before issuing export permits, in a bid to control local cooking oil prices. This has led to a surge in stocks and a slump in prices.
As a result, the plantation segment will take necessary steps to ensure that all estates and mills remain efficient, cost-effective and competitive.
For the hotels and resorts segment, Oriental said that with the accelerating vaccination programmes and greater immunity, the segment will make a comeback following several countries lifting their international travel restrictions and opening to vaccinated travellers.
The group said the healthcare segment will continue to focus on strengthening brand awareness and positioning the hospital for sustainable growth.
Shares in Oriental Holdings closed up seven sen or 1.05% at RM6.72, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM4.17 billion.

24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (New Straits Times), Kuala Lumpur - Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research anticipates TSH Resources Bhd's second half of 2022 (2H22) net profit to be lower following the recent crude palm oil (CPO) average selling price (ASP) correction and cost pressures.
The bank-backed research firm said TSH Resources's second quarter (Q2) 2022 headline net profit of RM57 million included a gain on disposal of assets that was offset by impairment of assets, foreign exchange (forex) loss, and fair value (FV) loss on biological assets.
Adjusted, the firm said overall 1H22 net profit met its and consensus expectations at 70 per cent and 62 per cent, respectively.
Meanwhile, Maybank IB said TSH Resources' 1H22 fresh fruit bunch (FFB) output met 47 per cent of the firm's full-year forecast.
""There is potential for 2H22 output to play strong catch up as the strong output in 1H21 was indeed an anomaly.
""We maintain our two per cent year-on-year (YoY) FFB output growth forecast for FY22,"" it said.
Moving forward, Maybank IB has maintained its net profit forecasts for TSH Resources as it anticipates earnings growth to slow sharply in 2H22.
The research firm said this is due to the recent CPO price correction and cost pressures, especially higher fertiliser prices.
""Nonetheless, 2H headline profits could be further boosted by land disposals in Kalimantan that are being completed in stages.
""Pending clarity, we have yet to factor in these additional land disposal gains in our forecasts.
""Given the lack of FFB growth prospects, TSH Resources remains a Hold with an unchanged target price of 98 sen,"" it added.

24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contracts on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives extended gains to close higher on Wednesday, spurred by positive market sentiment.
Mumbai-based Sunvin Group commodity research head Anilkumar Bagani said the local market was influenced by the bullish momentum in the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean oil futures overnight and a mid-session flurry in China’s vegetable oil futures.
He said the prolonged heatwave in the United States (US) soybean plantation areas is potentially damaging the standing soybean crops — fewer pods than last year in key areas — and lifting US soybean and product prices up.
“However, the rally in the CBOT soybean oil futures has been completely neutralised by the falling soybean oil basis in South America and the bullish sentiments did not fully convert into a follow-up buying in related vegetable oil markets today,” he told Bernama.
On the local front, the Malaysian Palm Oil Association announced that Malaysia’s CPO production for August 1-20 rose 16.18% month-on-month, with production in Peninsular Malaysia increasing by 11.87%, Sabah (33.36%), Sarawak (+4.66%), while East Malaysia (+24.81%).
Meanwhile, Indonesia Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan told Members of Parliament on Wednesday that the country decided to extend its palm oil export levy waiver till Oct 31 to help encourage exports of palm oil and prop up prices of palm oil fruits for farmers.
The world’s largest palm oil producer started slashing its export levy for all palm oil products from mid-July.
At the close, the CPO futures contract for the spot month of September 2022 increased by RM63 to RM4,290 a tonne, October 2022 improved by RM70 to RM4,304.0, November 2022 was RM74 higher at RM4,308 and December 2022 gained RM78 to RM4,325.
Meanwhile, January 2023 advanced by RM78 to RM4,354 and February 2023 gained RM68 to RM4,379.
Total volume expanded to 88,582 lots from 74,769 lots on Tuesday, while open interest widened to 264,898 contracts from 253,122 contracts previously.
The physical CPO price for September South was RM70 higher at RM4,350 a tonne.

24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - Boosted by sharply higher palm oil prices, Genting Plantation Bhd’s net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022 (2QFY22) more than doubled to RM223.43 million or earnings per share of 24.9 sen, from RM104.63 million or 11.66 sen.
Quarterly revenue was higher by 32.36% to RM1.05 billion from RM790.11 million.
The group declared an interim single-tier dividend of 15 sen per share, four sen higher than the 11 sen declared for the corresponding period of 2021. The latest dividend payout’s ex date falls on Sept 9, to be paid on Sept 26.
Compared with its preceding quarter of 1QFY22, its net profit also soared 91.55% from RM116.64 million due to higher fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production and better margins from the downstream manufacturing segment while revenue jumped 97.16% from RM530.43 million.
The strong quarterly performance also lifted its cumulative first half net profit (1H22) to RM340.08 million, twice its net profit of RM168.36 million a year ago. Revenue also rose 18.81% to RM1.58 billion from RM1.33 billion previously.
In a statement filed with Bursa Malaysia on Wednesday, Genting Plantations said it registered higher year-on-year (y-o-y) revenue for 2Q22 and for 1H22 on the back of strengthening palm product prices, which more than compensated for lower FFB production and sales volume of refined palm products.
“The group’s achieved crude palm oil price in 2Q22 and 1H22 were RM4,907 per tonne and RM4,860 per tonne respectively, while palm kernel price in 2Q22 and 1H22 were RM3,484 per tonne and RM3,777 per tonne respectively.
""The crude palm oil price in 2Q21 and 1H21 were RM3,250 per tonne and RM3,105 per tonne respectively, while palm kernel price stood at RM2,385 per tonne in 2Q21 and RM2,322 per tonne in 1H21.
“The group’s FFB production in 2Q 2022 and 1H 2022 were lower y-o-y as persistent wet weather affected harvester outturn while certain estates were faced with logistic issues as heavy rainfall caused flooding and damaged access roads, particularly in Indonesia,” it explained.
It added that Malaysia continued with its replanting programme which led to a reduction in harvesting area.
Moving forward, the group said prospects for the second half of 2022 (2H22) will track the performance of its mainstay plantation segment, which is in turn dependent principally on the movements in palm products prices and the group’s FFB production.
In the short run, the group expects palm oil prices to remain under pressure from the mounting stockpile in Indonesia as a result of its export ban.
Nonetheless, the Indonesian government has since introduced various measures to ease the swelling stockpile, which may provide some support to palm oil prices, it noted. 
While FFB production was weaker in 1H22, the group anticipates an improvement in 2H22 with favourable age profile and additional harvesting area in Indonesia, barring any weather anomalies.
Nevertheless, the production growth may be moderated by the on-going replanting activities in Malaysia, it added.
Genting Plantations’s share price closed down three sen or 0.46% at RM6.49 on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM5.82 billion.

25/08/2022,"25/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - Far East Holdings Bhd’s net profit more than doubled to RM70.18 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022 (Q2 2022) from RM32.54 million, fuelled by firmer crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK) prices, as well as higher fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, the oil palm plantation company said its revenue also jumped to RM242.36 million from RM153.72 million previously.
It said during the quarter under review, the average CPO price was higher by 69% per tonne, while the average PK price grew 33% per tonne compared with the same period last year.
FFB production increased 2% from Q2 2021, it said.
For the cumulative six-month period ended June 30, 2022, Far East saw its net profit soar to RM127.47 million against RM59.4 million previously, while revenue surged to RM429.43 million from RM273.47 million before.
On prospects, the group expects its performance for the current financial year to continue to be challenging due to rising operation costs, higher wages, volatility of CPO prices, and labour shortages.
“FFB production is expected to be stable in 2022, and the group’s financial result for 2022 is anticipated to be higher than the preceding year in view of higher CPO prices,” it said.

24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (The Edge Markets) - Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd's net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022 (2QFY22) jumped 41.08% to RM66.9 million from RM47.42 million a year ago, on the back of higher selling prices for crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK), despite lower sales.
Earnings per share climbed to 8.37 sen from 5.93 sen, the planter’s Bursa Malaysia filing on Wednesday (Aug 24) showed. Revenue grew 36.33% to RM246.86 million from RM181.07 million.
It declared a first interim dividend of five sen per share — as opposed to 1.5 sen in the corresponding quarter last year — to be paid on Sept 22.
Hap Seng Plantations said the average selling price (ASP) per tonne for CPO in 2QFY22 rose to RM6,737 from RM4,365 in 2QFY21, while PK's climbed to RM3,769 from RM2,709. The stronger ASPs offset the 10% drop in CPO sales volume as well as the 14% fall in PK sales volume in the same period.
It said the drop in sales volume was mostly due to lower production; production of CPO dropped 16% in 2QFY22, while PK's fell 14%, due to lower fresh fruit bunches (FFB) produced and purchased.
“FFB production in the current quarter was 13% below the preceding year's corresponding quarter (2QFY21), affected by lower FFB yield due to seasonal yield trend and changes in cropping patterns,” it added.
For the six months ended June 30, the planter posted a net profit of RM168.57 million, up 119.52% from the RM76.79 million it made in the corresponding six months last year, as cumulative revenue jumped 61.72% to RM489.02 million from RM302.39 million.
Hap Seng said CPO prices eased after the Indonesian government lifted its CPO export ban on May 23. Monthly average price per tonne of CPO, which ranged between RM5,354.50 and RM6,873 in the first half of 2022, dropped to RM4,063 per tonne in July — the lowest-to-date in 2022.
Looking forward, the planter said CPO prices are expected to soften further in the second half of 2022, on weaker global demand growth and expectations of higher palm oil supplies.
“Palm oil industry analysts expect average CPO price for 2022 to remain in the range of RM4,500 to RM5,600, supported by the tight supply situation of other vegetable oils and the wide price gaps between CPO and these oils,” it said.
Meanwhile, higher fertiliser costs as well as the increased minimum wage to RM1,500 — which took effect from May 1, 2022, under the Malaysian Minimum Wage Order 2022 — will also continue to push production costs higher, it said.
“Based on the foregoing, the group expects its results for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2022 (FY22), to be influenced by movements in commodities prices, rising production costs, uncertainties in the global economies and the global shift from the Covid-19 pandemic to endemic stage,” it added.
Shares in Hap Seng Plantations finished unchanged at RM2.23 on Wednesday, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM1.78 billion.

24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (Antara News), Jakarta - Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto believes that existence of the palm oil industry and its products should be able to increase the people's welfare.
""We need to continue to encourage this high export potential in line with the price increase in palm oil commodities for the welfare of the community,"" Hartarto noted at the 5th Borneo Forum organized by the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (Gapki), as quoted from an official statement received here, Wednesday.
He remarked that the palm oil industry should be able to build rural progress, reduce poverty significantly, and absorb a high number of workers.
In addition, development of this industry must prioritize aspects of sustainability for the environment and society in order to comply with the principles of sustainable development, Hartarto stated.
""The large contribution of the palm oil plantation sector must be accompanied by sustainability for the environment and the wider community,"" he remarked.
He later highlighted that the government had implemented various comprehensive policy frameworks and encouraged multi-stakeholder cooperation to consider environmental sustainability aspects of this industry.
The policy framework is in the form of the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) Certification, the National Action Plan for Sustainable Palm Oil (RAN-KSB) 2019-2024, and the National Strategic Program on People's Palm Oil Rejuvenation (PSR).
On the occasion, the minister also urged regional heads to oversee the sustainability of palm oil investment, provide legal certainty for businesses, encourage the implementation of the people's palm rejuvenation (PSR) program, maintain partnerships between smallholder palm oil plantations and large plantations, facilitate problem-solving, and promote the palm oil industry in their area.
With such efforts, Hartarto believes that the palm oil industry would contribute to regional development.
As is known, Indonesia is the largest palm oil-producing country that accounts for 54 percent of the world's market share. The export of industrial products is reported to reach more than 125 countries in the food, energy, and various other downstream industries.

24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (Business Recorder), Jakarta - Malaysia’s palm oil futures rose for a fourth straight session on Wednesday, tracking gains in soy oil prices amid concerns over weak US output, while investors awaited domestic export data for further cues.
The benchmark palm oil contract for November delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange had risen 1.58% to 4,301 ringgit ($958.76) a tonne by the midday break. Palm oil rose on the back of “spillover strength” from rival edibles oils on the US and Chinese exchanges, a trader in Kuala Lumpur said.
Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade were up 0.66%, while Dalian’s soyoil contract gained 2.24% and its palm oil contract rose 2.21%. Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils, as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.
Chicago grains futures extended gains, as a tour of key growing areas in the Midwest raised concerns that the size of the US corn and soybean crops will fall below expectations.
Palm oil may retest resistance at 4,269 ringgit
Meanwhile, traders awaited cargo surveyor data for Malaysian palm oil exports during Aug. 1-25 as production this month is seen rising. Export data for Aug. 1-20 were mixed, with two cargo surveyors saying shipments dropped on a monthly basis, while one reported a growth.
Palm oil may test a resistance at 4,452 ringgit per tonne, a break above which could lead to a gain to 4,680 ringgit, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.

24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (Daily Express), Kuala Lumpur - Profit from Malaysia is likely to be affected by harvesters’ shortage but Sime Darby Plantation Bhd (SDP) is confident that other operations will be able to offset the fall.
Group managing director Mohamad Helmy Othman Basha said the group is facing a shortage of more than 4,000 workers, which presently has affected the harvesting process covering an area of 60,000 hectares.
Following this, the Malaysian operations can only produce less than half of the group’s total production in the first half of 2022.
“This is only applied to Malaysia, which makes up 50 per cent of our operations, but there is another 50 per cent that should be doing well because there should not be any impediment to our production in other countries,” he told reporters during SDP’s second quarter financial year 2022 (Q2FY2022) performance media briefing Tuesday.
To mitigate the issue, SDP will bring in at least 3,000 foreign workers in stages by the end of 2022.
It will also be capitalising on the months in which production usually declines, which will begin next month until November.
SDP also faces challenges from Indonesia following export restrictions.
Managing director Sime Darby Oils Mohd Haris Mohd Arshad said it needs to set aside one tonne of oil for the local market for every four tonnes of oil to be exported.
“That is slowing down our activities because you first have to find someone willing to buy for the local market. Only after you sell in the local market and to local buyers, can you export.
“So, that affects our operational efficiency,” he said.
Mohd Haris also said the firm lost an opportunity to sell because it was unable to export in May 2022 when the crude palm oil (CPO) prices were trading at above RM6,000 per tonne.
Overall, he said crude palm oil prices are likely to remain at the current range but slightly higher at RM4,500 by year-end.
The lowest price level is expected at RM3,500, he added.
SDP’s net profit surged 32 per cent to RM812 million in the second quarter (Q2) ended June 30, 2022, from RM617 million in Q2 2021, boosted by stronger realised average crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK) prices.
Revenue climbed to RM5.59 billion from RM4.41 billion previously.
In Q2, the average realised CPO and PK prices jumped by 44 per cent and 40 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM5,213 per tonne and RM3,339 per tonne, respectively.
Fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production, however, was impacted by a prolonged labour shortage experienced in its Malaysian operations.

The group declared a second interim dividend of 2.75 sen per share, with an ex-date of Sept 12.
Revenue for the quarter under review rose 44% to RM348.96 million for 2QFY22 from RM242.78 million last year, Boustead Plantations said in a stock exchange filing.
For the first half of this year (1HFY22), net profit jumped over eight times to RM508.38 million from just RM60.6 million in the previous corresponding period, on the back of 62% growth in revenue to RM673.11 million from RM414.72 million.
In 2HFY22, Boustead Plantations said palm oil prices are expected to sustain as the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict is likely to limit the supply of edible oils and poor weather conditions in Europe and America will contribute to further crop losses.
Nonetheless, the group expects production costs to be higher in 2HFY22 due to impact of minimum wages and increase in fertiliser and diesel prices.
“Despite the challenges, the group is positive on the outcome from the ongoing effort to manage cost efficiently through prudent spending and the crop improvement initiatives,” it said.

Revenue increased 44 per cent to RM348.96 million from RM242.78 million previously due to an increase in palm products prices, which led to the profit from operations of RM112.5 million, the plantation group said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.
In Q2, the average crude palm oil (CPO) price stood at RM6,611 per tonne, higher than last year's corresponding quarter of RM4,014 per tonne by 65 per cent.
The highest monthly average CPO price of RM6,857 per tonne was recorded in May 2022, which surpassed last quarter's highest monthly average CPO price of RM6,780 per tonne recorded in March 2022.
Chief executive officer Zainal Abidin Shariff said the group's latest performance was an outcome of the continuous efforts done in its yield performance initiatives, particularly the ongoing Plantations Performance Improvement Programme (PPIP), in addition to the group's ability to manage cost-effectively.
However, adverse weather and labour shortages continued to impact the group's yield performance, he said.
""In the current quarter, the increase in diesel prices is among factors affecting our production cost.
""Nevertheless, proactive measures that we have undertaken under the PPIP allowed us to offset the impact,"" he said.
On prospects, Zainal Abidin said the current price of palm oil is expected to experience a further correction in the second half of 2022, as stock levels are expected to be high due to factors of Indonesia lifting its export ban and increased quota on export, the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict and global climate change.
""The group is expected to achieve reasonable improvement in crop production in line with the progress of PPIP and Boustead Group's Reinventing Boustead Strategy.

,
24/08/2022,"24/08/2022 (Indonesia At Melbourne) - The recent collapse in oil palm prices to some of the lowest levels ever seen has hit smallholder farmers hard. In April, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo announced a ban on the export of crude palm oil (CPO) and its derivatives, in an attempt to address rapidly escalating cooking oil prices in the domestic market. The policy, which was quickly reversed in May, resulted in a drastic fall in the price of palm fruit, but had little impact on cooking oil prices.
The saga is illustrative of the poor governance that characterises the national palm oil industry, especially so-called “upstream” activities relating to plantations. The sector is the largest contributor to Indonesia’s foreign exchange earnings, but policy formulation often appears reactive, without any clear roadmap or efforts to prevent these kinds of problems from occurring. In the end, smallholders – and Indonesian consumers – lose out.
If the government wants to avoid another crisis in the future, it has a lot of work to do. Most of the pressing problems in the sector can be broadly grouped under the field of business and human rights, and relate to inequality of land tenure, poor welfare of smallholders and workers, and conflicts with local communities.
For example, according to data from the Business Competition Supervisory Commission (KPPU), smallholders comprise 99.92% of all oil palm growers but control just 41.35% of plantations. Meanwhile, private companies make up just 0.07% of growers, but control 54.42% of plantations. Since 2007, Indonesian law has required companies to dedicate 20% of any new plantation to local communities. But recent reports have suggested that of the 5 million hectares of plantations established from 2007 to 2021, only 635,000 (about 13%) have been designated for communities. This land inequality is a serious problem because it allows major corporations to dictate the terms of the market, while smallholders struggle.
Further, nongovernmental organisation Sawit Watch has estimated that 70% of the 10.4 million people who work on oil palm plantations are daily contract workers who work without guarantees of job security. The sector also faces major challenges with unequal treatment of women workers and child labour. In January, Indonesia was stunned by a shocking case of modern slavery in Langkat, North Sumatra, where more than 40 people were forced to work on an oil palm plantation without pay.
Conflict between palm oil corporations and smallholders and local communities is also widespread. The “Palm Oil Conflict and Access to Justice in Indonesia” (POCAJI) collaborative research project examined 150 cases of conflict between local communities (many of whom are also smallholders and farmers) and palm oil companies in Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, Riau and West Sumatra. It found that 63 of these cases (42%) involved arrests of members of the community. A total 789 community members were arrested, 243 people were injured, and 19 people died.
Few cases of conflict between smallholders and community members and corporations make it to the courtroom. Companies often attempt to establish plantations on land that communities have managed for years. But when smallholders and community members sue corporations to claim their land, they often lose because they lack strong legal evidence of ownership.
The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) prepared a standard on Principles and Criteria for Production of Sustainable Palm Oil in 2018, in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The RSPO is an international nongovernmental organisation of palm oil producers, retailers and civil society organisations that certifies palm oil producers and products for sustainability.
The RSPO principles clearly describe the state’s obligation to protect human rights, companies’ obligation to respect human rights, and efforts to expand access to remedies for victims, whether violations are caused by the state or companies. The 2018 standard calls on companies to apply due diligence and develop action plans to avoid human rights violations. The RSPO has developed a complaint handling system, intended to address violations by major corporations. But the complexity of the system, the costs involved, mistrust, and general lack of awareness mean that few smallholders access it.
In any case, the RSPO has shown that it has not been effective in resolving conflicts between companies and communities. The POCAJI research identified at least 64 cases of conflict involving RSPO member companies, but only 17 were reported to the RSPO – and just three of those were successfully resolved.
Existing laws and regulations have clearly not been able to protect the rights of smallholders and local communities when they deal with large oil palm companies.
The government has launched its own sustainability certification scheme, called Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO). It is now mandatory for companies to seek certification with the scheme, which claims to have the goal of developing economically viable, socially and culturally appropriate, and environmentally friendly palm oil. But there have been serious problems with the system. Its standards have been criticised for being insufficient to protect customary land, monitoring reports have been weak, and there is widespread evidence of non-compliance.
Jokowi has also issued Presidential Instruction No. 8 of 2018, which involved a moratorium on granting new permits for oil palm plantations. This policy was important not only for limiting deforestation, but also because it offered much-needed time to further strengthen land tenure governance and increase the productivity of smallholders. But the moratorium expired on 19 September 2021, and there is still no clarity about whether it will be renewed.
In terms of support for smallholders, the government has established the Indonesian Palm Oil Plantation Funds Management Agency (BPDPKS). One of its programs involves replanting smallholders’ plantations. But the budget dedicated to these activities is miniscule – most of the agency’s budget goes toward the development of biofuel. The major recipients of its funds are therefore large oil palm corporations, who are, of course, the source of most of the problems the sector faces.
Weak implementation of regulations in the palm oil sector is another major issue, and it often results in serious human rights violations, especially against smallholder oil palm farmers. Improving the situation for smallholders will require a cross-sectoral regulation based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Fortunately, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights is aware of these problems and has begun preparing a National Strategy for Business and Human Rights based on the UN Guiding Principles, and has involved government, business and civil society stakeholders in discussions. It is urging Jokowi to issue a presidential regulation that will promote harmonisation of regulations and policies on business and human rights, and encourage access to remedies for those who have suffered rights violations as a result of business activities.
The regulation is late coming, and is not as progressive as other regulations elsewhere, such as the EU’s recently issued Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence. Even so, it offers hope local communities and smallholder farmers might one day be on a more even playing field with large oil palm companies.
Human rights and environmental activists have long highlighted serious problems with Indonesia’s palm oil sector. Recent government attention to business and human rights principles is promising. The government’s decision to ban palm oil exports hurt smallholder farmers and was a serious policy fumble. But let’s hope it will promote more serious efforts to improve the situation for smallholders and workers who have been victims of this troubled industry for too long.

23/08/2022,"23/08/2022 (Business Recorder), Singapore - Palm oil may retest a resistance at 4,269 ringgit per tonne, a break above which could lead to a gain to 4,452 ringgit.
The stabilization of the price around 4,085 ringgit suggests a completed correction from the Aug. 12 high of 4,495 ringgit.
The bounce from 4,000 ringgit may consist of three waves.
The wave c is expected to travel into 4,269-4,452 ringgit range.
A break below 4,085 ringgit would signal the extension of the correction towards 3,717-3,857 ringgit range. On the daily chart, signals are a bit mixed, while palm oil is stuck in a neutral range of 4,070-4,331 ringgit.

Wave pattern suggests a downside bias, as the contract could be riding on a wave (5) which targets 3,522 ringgit.
This wave will be confirmed when the contract breaks 4,070 ringgit.
A break above 4,331 ringgit could indicate an extension of the uptrend towards 4,543 ringgit.

23/08/2022,"23/08/2022 (The Star Online), Kuala Lumpur - IOI Corp Bhd, which saw its net profit jump 50.7% to RM541.8mil in the second quarter ended June 30, expects its financial performance for the financial year ending June 30, 2023 (FY23) to be lower than for FY22 but remain healthy.
IOI said crude palm oil (CPO) price has weakened since early June following various measures introduced by the Indonesian government to first restrict and then boost export.
The plantation group anticipates price will be supported by supply constraints and its price competitiveness against other edible oils at least until December 2022,” it said.
“For FY23, our plantation segment’s financial performance is expected to decline due to the drop in CPO price from the historically high levels during FY22 and the elevated cost of inputs such as fuel and fertiliser.
“Nevertheless, CPO price should still be significantly higher than its historical average, and therefore the financial performance of our plantation segment is expected to be satisfactory,” IOI said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
The group expects the refining and fractionation margins to be volatile and decline from the present high levels as the CPO export duty drops in tandem with the CPO price.
Nonetheless, it said demand for palm oil will still be resilient to make up for the low sunflower oil supply which is expected to persist into 2023.
For the oleochemical sub-segment, IOI anticipates China’s zero Covid policy and ongoing Ukraine-Russia war will continue to dampen China’s domestic demand and cause a severe inflationary impact on food to energy respectively.
“Nevertheless, with our new fatty acid and soap noodles plants coming on-stream, our sales volume in FY2023 is expected to increase by double-digit percentage but with margins lower than the high levels achieved in FY22,” the group said.
“For FY23, we expect the performance of the specialty fats sub-segment comprising our associate company Bunge Loders Croklaan (BLC) to be satisfactory as it benefits from favourable demand and BLC’s supply chain capability, although the operating environment will continue to present challenges such as high energy cost and the sporadic pandemic-related lockdowns in China.
“Overall, the group expects its financial performance for FY23 to be lower than for FY22 but remain healthy,” IOI said.
In the fourth quarter, its revenue rose 8% to RM3.74bil from RM3.46bil in the same period last year. Its earnings per share stood at 8.72 sen against 5.74 sen previously.
IOI’s board has declared a second interim single-tier dividend of 8.0 sen per ordinary share in respect of FY22. The dividend will be payable on Sept 23.
For FY22, IOI posted a net profit of RM1.72bil, or 27.74 sen earnings per share on revenue of RM15.58bil.

23/08/2022,"23/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - CI Holdings Bhd's net profit grew 13% in the final quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (4QFY22) on the back of stronger revenue, driven by higher palm olein prices and a stronger US dollar against the ringgit.
The group is involved in the manufacturing and packing of all types of edible oils as well as making water taps and other plumbing accessories.
Its net profit rose to RM25.02 million in 4QFY22 from RM22.13 million a year ago, while revenue jumped 41% to RM1.26 billion from RM900.15 million, the group said in a stock exchange filing Tuesday.
Nonetheless, CI Holdings said earnings grew at a slower pace than revenue growth during 4QFY22 as margin came under pressure after administrative expenses ballooned by over three times.
For the full FY22, net profit fell 5% to RM66.49 million from RM69.97 million in FY21, despite revenue increasing by 29% to RM4.05 billion from RM3.14 billion.
Going forward, the group said it will continue to grow its revenue via expansion plans for edible oil operations and through smart partnerships with property developers for the tapware and sanitary ware divisions to enhance shareholders’ value.
CI Holdings, which is 33%-controlled by former second finance minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani, closed one sen or 0.35% lower at RM2.84 per share on Tuesday, giving it a market capitalisation of RM460.08 million.

22/08/2022,"22/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - TSH Resources Bhd’s net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022 (2QFY22) rose 44.37% to RM57.34 million from RM39.72 million in the same period last year, as its palm product segment benefited from higher average selling prices of crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK).
This was despite the segment being impacted by the increase in Indonesia's export levy and duty on CPO, as well as lower fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production, mainly due to ongoing replanting and wet weather conditions earlier this year.
Earnings per share was up 4.15 sen from 2.88 sen previously, the oil palm planter’s bourse filing on Monday (Aug 22) showed.
Quarterly revenue grew 38.06% to RM424.41 million — its highest to date — from RM307.41 million in the same period a year ago, thanks to higher revenue contribution from the group’s palm products segment.
For the first six month of the financial year, TSH’s net profit surged 154.23% to RM153.81 million, from RM60.5 million a year ago.
Meanwhile, cumulative six months' revenue increased 38.13% to RM761.76 million, from RM551.49 million.
TSH noted that CPO prices had fallen sharply since May this year, following Indonesia’s decision to remove the ban on palm oil export, as well as market concerns over rising palm oil stockpiles.
However, this appears to have stabilised in recent times and is currently hovering at around RM4,000+ per metric tonne.
“It is anticipated that the CPO price will remain supported at current levels, on the back of supply concerns arising from the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict and softer production outlook for soybean due to the return of La Nina in late 2022 and early 2023,” said TSH.
Looking ahead, TSH remains optimistic on the long-term prospects of the palm oil industry.
This is given restrained hectarage growth in oil palm planting over the last few years due to Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) regulations, and the Indonesian government’s moratorium on deforestation will have an impact over the global palm oil supply.
“Global population and per capita income growth, as well as the many health qualities of palm oil are expected to drive greater demand for palm products.” added TSH.
TSH’s share price settled down three sen or 2.68% at RM1.09 on Monday, giving the counter a market capitalisation of RM1.51 billion.

22/08/2022,"22/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contracts on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives (BMD) closed higher on Monday (Aug 22) on better demand for the golden fruits.
Mumbai-based Sunvin Group commodity research head Anilkumar Bagani said the local market was influenced by bullish sentiments exhibited on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soya oil and Dalian Commodity Exchange refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm olein futures.
However, he said gains were limited, as investors sought more clarity on the export performance during the first 20 days of the month.
“Malaysia palm oil export during Aug 1-20 came in a wider range with cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services estimating it at 728,000, up 9.1%, while AmSpec Group, on a contrasting line, [estimated it] at 622,000, down by 3.8%.
“The 100,000 difference between [the] two estimates is very abnormal and failed to give any concrete view [on] the overall export scenario,” he told Bernama.
Anilkumar said the market is now waiting for the Aug 1-20 palm oil production data from UOB, as well as the Malaysian Palm Oil Association (MPOA) and Southern Peninsula Palm Oil Millers’ Association (SPPOMA) for guidance to assess the August-end palm oil inventories.
Meanwhile, he said demand from India is expected to pick up ahead of several festivals, including Deepavali, in the next two months, amidst domestic soybean crush.
At the close, CPO futures contract for spot month September 2022 increased by RM73 to RM4,163 a tonne, October 2022 improved RM52 to RM4,153 a tonne, November 2022 was RM67 higher at RM4,160 a tonne, and December 2022 gained RM77 to RM4,180 a tonne.
January 2023 jumped RM82 to RM4,214 a tonne, and February 2023 climbed RM72 to RM4,253 a tonne.
Total volume declined to 47,905 lots, from 59,652 lots on Friday (Aug 19); while open interest widened to 228,669 contracts, from 183,505 contracts previously.

23/08/2022,"23/08/2022 (Hellenic Shipping News) - Malaysia’s benchmark palm oil futures extended gains to a second session on Monday, helped by stronger vegetable oils, a weaker ringgit, and supportive export data.
The benchmark palm oil contract FCPOc3 for November delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange had risen 3.05% to 4,218 ringgit ($941.52) a tonne by the midday break.
Palm futures were higher “on the back of strong Dalian palm oil, good export data and a further weakening of the ringgit,” a trader in Kuala Lumpur said.
Dalian’s palm oil contract DCPv1 rose 3.35%, while its soyoil contract DBYv1 gained 1.91%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade BOc2 were up 0.41%.
Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.
Meanwhile, the Malaysian ringgit MYR= weakened for a sixth straight session against the dollar, trading near its lowest level since 2016.
A weaker ringgit makes Malaysian palm oil more attractive for buyers with foreign currency.
Exports of Malaysian palm oil products for Aug. 1-20 rose 9.1% to 728,165 tonnes from the same period in July, cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services said on Saturday, while independent inspection company AmSpec Agri Malaysia reported a 3.8% drop.

The Fitch group unit said in a note, for the remainder of 2022, it sees a slight recovery in the palm oil price from the year-to-date lows seen in July and early-August.
This is because that the price-led demand destruction that took place in the first half is unwound, with vegetable oil importers in major consuming nations, such as India and China, resuming or increasing foreign purchases of palm oil.
Besides, it said Indonesian palm oil inventories start to decline or, at least, accumulate at a slower rate.

22/08/2022,"22/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - Fitch Solutions Country Risk and Industry Research anticipates the current downward trend in crude palm oil (CPO) prices to continue in the next four years to a low of RM2,600 per tonne in 2026.
The research outfit expects the edible oil prices to decline 23.1% year-on-year to RM4,000 per tonne next year. It reasons that the effects of one-off events that occurred in the first half of 2022 — the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Indonesian palm oil export ban — are to ease further.
Its assessment is that CPO prices are to continue their downturn to an average palm oil price of RM3,033 per tonne between 2024 and 2026 in view of consistent annual surpluses set to weigh on prices. It forecasts annual average palm oil prices of RM3,500 per tonne for 2024, RM3,000 per tonne for 2025 and RM2,600 per tonne for 2026, according to a note it issued on Monday (Aug 22).
It noted that this forecast is founded on its palm oil production and consumption forecasts, which foresee the global palm oil market to generate an annual production surplus from 2022 to 2026 — rising from 2.5 million tonnes in 2022 and 2023, to 3.9 million tonnes in 2026. It noted that this is still below the record high surplus of 4.5 million tonnes generated in 2017 and 2018.
Fitch Solutions noted that palm oil prices touched RM7,074 per tonne on March 3, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February this year, while it climbed to a height of RM7,104 per tonne on April 29 — a day after the Indonesian government implemented its ban on the export of palm oil.
“We do not see a return to the historically elevated price levels evident in 1HFY22 (first half of 2022), in no small part as we do not expect Indonesia to reintroduce its short-lived palm oil ban of 2Q2022 (second quarter of 2022).
“We also highlight the loosening of the aggregate vegetable oils market more generally as indicative of less acute upward price pressure in the rest of 3Q2022 and during 4Q2022,” it added.
Over the next five-year period, Fitch Solutions forecasts a production compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9%, led amongst the largest producers by Nigeria (CAGR of 5%), Colombia (4.8%), and Indonesia (4.3%). As for the demand, it foresees a consumption CAGR of 3.6%, led by mainland China (CAGR of 9.6%) where it predicted that per capita palm oil consumption will rise from 3.49kg (in 2021 and 2022) to 4.98kg (in 2025 and 2026).
“Overall, we see global palm oil production and consumption increasing from 76.6 million to 89.3 million tonnes (up 12.7 million tonnes) and from 74.1 million to 85.4 million tonnes (up 11.3 million tonnes) by the end of our forecast horizon,” it added.
On the potential risks to its forecast, Fitch Solutions noted that there is a short-term downside risk for palm oil prices to diminish further in view that the Indonesian government could strengthen its efforts to accelerate export sales, which would in turn prompt a price depression in the market.
It said this could be an action the Indonesian government may take as the nation’s large accumulated palm oil inventories have yet to start to decline, which indicates that palm oil demand may be weaker than expected through the remainder of 2022.
Fitch Solution pegs the average CPO prices in the next four months to decline to RM4,750 per tonne for the rest of 2022.
The research house noted that this is in line with its unchanged annual average palm oil price forecast of RM5,200 per tonne for 2022.
Meanwhile, a potential long-term upside risk to these forecasts is Indonesia and Malaysia’s “eventual” transformation from reliance on extensive production growth to intensive, yield-driven growth.
“The increasing prominence of sustainability concerns, both inside the major producing nations (Indonesia and Malaysia) as well as in consuming nations, and the increasing scarcity of available land into which to expand palm oil production further will necessitate a fundamental shift in industry strategy to one focused on intensive, yield- and investment-driven growth.
“The extent to which this transformation is achieved will determine, to a large extent, future output growth and so progress that is slower than expected will weigh on output and pose an upside price risk,” the research house explained.

19.08.2022,"19.08.2022 (www.nst.com.my) - KUALA LUMPUR: Illegal hunting activities due to human-wildlife conflict have been identified as the main reason behind wildlife extinction.
Minister of Plantation Industries and Commodities Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said the government wanted to quash allegations of palm oil being the biggest threat to the orang utans by clarifying that it was human overpopulation that has become a threat to wildlife survival.
""While it is true that orang utans in Borneo have become an endangered species, it is also true that many other animal species have become endangered due to the explosion of the human population that leads to conflict.
""Recent evidence has revealed that hunting is among the biggest contributors to the Bornean orang utan population decline over the last 200 years,"" she said.
Speaking in conjunction with International Orang Utan Day, which is celebrated every year today (Aug 19), she said Malaysia had implemented various initiatives to conserve and protect its wildlife and biodiversity in an effort to find a middle ground between oil palm cultivation and preserving nature.
""In the guise of wanting to save the orang utans, some campaigners have embarked on disseminating provocative statements.
""These include allegations that an area the equivalent size of 300 football fields of rainforest is cleared each hour to make way for palm oil production, that 25 orang utans' lives are lost every day, and that orang utans will be extinct within the next five to 10 years.""
She stressed that in Kalimantan, Bornean orang utans were often shot for its meat or killed as a result of human- orang utan conflict.
Historical data shows that the decline of orang utans was recorded as far back as the 19th century, way before the start of significant oil palm development in the 1970s.
According to research, Zuraida said, changes in land and sea use in Asia Pacific make up only 43 per cent of the factors threatening wildlife populations.
More than 50 per cent is due to species overexploitation, invasive species and diseases, hunting, pollution and climate change, she said.
""In research conducted by Statista, all wildlife, not just orang utans, are threatened across the world. They are not limited to other monkey and animal species that inhabit Borneo per se, but is also spread across North America, Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, Caribbean and Africa.
""Asserting that oil palm is the sole reason that threatens wildlife such as orang utans selectively negates the facts causing the population decrease of all endangered animal species,"" she said.
To promote better co-existence, she said Malaysia has allotted 43 sq km of protected land at the edge of the Kabili Sepilok Forest Reserve in Sabah as a rehabilitation site for orang utans.
""Today around 60 to 80 orang utans are living independently in the reserve while approximately 25 orphaned orang utans are housed in the nurseries.
""With the exponential growth of the human population on the planet, a world without palm oil can surely lead to a global food crisis given that the golden oil makes up over 60 per cent of the global edible oils market,"" she said.
The country is also totally committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCC) 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) on climate change.
At the ministerial level, Zuraida said MPIC has initiated the Malaysian Palm Oil Green Conservation Foundation (MPOGCF) through the Malaysian Palm Oil Council as a sustainability platform funded by voluntary monetary contribution from numerous players in the palm oil industry.
In this regard, industry players and MPOGCF are joining forces with Sabah Wildlife Department to support wildlife rescue and conservation efforts.
""In tandem with clearing the gross misconceptions over the well-being of orang utans, it is equally vital for MPIC to counter misinformation on Malaysia's golden oil via ""The Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil"" campaign,"" she added.

22.08.2022,"22.08.2022 (www.businesstimes.com.sg) - Crude palm oil futures rose sharply over the last 2 weeks from lows of RM3,700 (S$1,150) a tonne, propelled by gains in soybean oil on the Chicago Board Of Trade (CBOT) and expectations of better exports for the month of August. The world’s largest producer and exporter, Indonesia, recently announced an increase in export taxes for shipments for the week of Aug 9 to Aug 15, giving Malaysian crude palm oil (CPO) priced in ringgit a competitive edge.
Owing to ideal rainfall and favourable weather conditions, a surplus in palm oil production is expected to hit markets in August and September as the seasonal peak production season gets underway. Inventories of top exporter Indonesia have swollen to 10 million tonnes compared to the average of 5 million tonnes, fully utilising capacity storage in tanks, wells and barges. After a drop from highs by 45 per cent, Indonesian palm oil is currently the cheapest vegetable oil in market.
Looking at the weekly chart, palm oil double topped at levels of RM7,200 on Mar 9, 2022, followed by highs on Apr 29, just after the Indonesian government announced an export ban on Apr 28. The catastrophic move to safeguard local prices and counter the threat posed by ongoing geopolitical crisis that was expected to halt the global supply of soybean oil, sunflower oil and other vegetable oils, backfired by destroying local demand and increasing Indonesian stockpiles.
Soaring palm oil prices amid a potential recession along with the economic downturn in China threatened demand even further, resulting in a free fall in palm oil prices to the lows of RM3,700 in mid-July.
The historic high and low levels of RM3,000 to RM3,200, before palm oil started an uptrend in October 2020, continue to act as strong support. Market talk projects that the world’s most consumed cooking oil may continue its slide towards RM3,000 to RM3,200 a tonne by September this year, driven by surging supplies from Indonesia.
The upward trend line joining lows since May 2020 has been breached and will now act as resistance whenever prices try to break through. In its recent rise, palm oil touched the 50 day moving average at 4,438 and for the next few weeks it should consolidate between a larger range of 3,700 to 5,000 without the intervention of any market-moving events.
But are technicals sufficient to guide volatile movements in agricultural commodities? Demand-supply dynamics have a part to play as well. The world’s production of 7 oilseeds is estimated at 610 million tonnes, up by 33.4 million tonnes for 2023, with supplies expected to pour in during the first quarter of 2023. Ongoing geopolitical crisis will pose constant bullish threat as supply chains look restricted; we should witness some recovery in prices before soybean oil, corn oil and rapeseed oil supplies from the southern hemisphere hit the market in 2023. There is also the possibility of the resumption of the flow of sunflower oil from the Black Sea region in the likelihood of a ceasefire.

22.08.2022,"22.08.2022 (www.theborneopost.com) - KUCHING (Aug 22): The oil palm sector continues to face a multitude of challenges that require government’s support from time to time.
In stating this, Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association (Soppoa) chief executive officer Dr Felix Moh says the slow arrival of Indonesian workers remains a challenge to oil palm growers who are still facing critical shortage of workers since the Covid-19 lockdown.
“The Indonesian government may have imposed certain restrictions to discourage its citizens to work in Malaysia, but the long processing time of the applications for the approved permit (AP), new labour licence and calling visa have also, to a certain degree, contributed to the delay in employing foreign workers,” he said in a statement issued in connection with a visit conducted by Soppoa members to State Secretary Dato Sri Mohamad Abu Bakar Marzuki at Wisma Bapa Malaysia here recently.
The Soppoa delegation was headed by chairman Eric Kiu.
For the record, Soppoa members represent about 70 per cent of the total planted oil palm areas in Sarawak, and they (members) comprise mostly oil palm growers operating at various scales, including government land development agencies and independent smallholders.
According to Moh, currently Sarawak has 1.61 million hectares of oil palm plantations and 84 palm oil mills. Last year, the state produced 3.90 million tonnes of crude palm oil (CPO).
Meanwhile, Kiu said the palm oil industry had generated significant amount of tax revenues for the country in 2021, including Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) cess amounting to RM62.5 million, windfall profit levy of RM394 million, state sales tax of RM1 billion, export tax of RM1.5 billion, and corporate tax of between 20 per cent and 28 per cent.
During the courtesy visit, Mohamad Abu Bakar had stated that the approval for new labour licence should ideally be given within a day, instead of seven days, and in this matter, he was confident that the processes would be streamlined soon.
Back to Kiu, he said Soppoa respected the decision by the Sarawak Cabinet for not granting the request to allow Bangladeshis to work in plantations at the moment.
However, he suggested that Timorese workers could be considered instead, in view of the cultural similarity between them and the Indonesians.
Kiu also thanked to Deputy Minister in Sarawak Premier’s Department (Labour, Immigration and Project Monitoring) Datuk Gerawat Gala for working tirelessly in seeking solution to all issues related to foreign workers over the past few months.
Adding further, Moh said palm oil was highly taxed in the country, with the rate between 47 and 52 per cent, with the state growers having to pay state sales tax upon the CPO price reaching RM1,000 per tonne.
It is informed that the rate would be capped at a maximum of five per cent should the CPO price rise above RM1,500 per tonne.
“The existing threshold for levying CPO was set in 1998 when the cost of production was lower.”
Moh said a survey carried out by Soppoa indicated that the cost of production had ranged between RM2,000 and RM2,300 per tonne from 2014 to 2019.
“Recently, due to higher input costs, many companies reported cost of production as being close to RM2,500 per tonne.”
In this regard, Moh said a new threshold at RM2,000 would be more reflective of the present industry landscape.
“Kiu informed that the suggestion to revise the existing threshold was brought to the Sarawak Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg’s attention earlier this year, and thanked him for consideration.”
Moh said the State Secretary had agreed to bring forward the matter to the State Financial Secretary for further studies.
Additionally, Moh also pointed out that nearly 44 per cent of oil palms were planted on peat soil in Sarawak that was marginal and prone to flooding.
“On top of that, it is more expensive to manage compares to mineral-soil estates.
“Peat oil estates are also susceptible to many other problems, such as high incidence of pests and diseases, lower fresh fruit yields and poorer oil extraction rate – just to name a few.”
Moh said the State Secretary had agreed that more research and development would need to be carried out to improve the productivity and sustainability of the oil palm sector in Sarawak, as the crop had always contributed significantly to the state’s economy.
“He (Mohamad Abu Bakar) also stressed that there are many excellent learning and research institutions in the state that can specialise in palm oil’s research and development.”
Moreover, Moh said the State Secretary had agreed to have more industrial engagements in the future.
“He (Mohamad Abu Bakar) is also receptive to the idea proposed by Soppoa of setting up a Sarawak-based palm oil agency to focus on the development of the industry here.”

22.08.2022,"22.08.2022 (www.theborneopost.com) - KUCHING (Aug 22): The oil palm sector continues to face a multitude of challenges that require government’s support from time to time.
In stating this, Sarawak Oil Palm Plantation Owners Association (Soppoa) chief executive officer Dr Felix Moh says the slow arrival of Indonesian workers remains a challenge to oil palm growers who are still facing critical shortage of workers since the Covid-19 lockdown.
“The Indonesian government may have imposed certain restrictions to discourage its citizens to work in Malaysia, but the long processing time of the applications for the approved permit (AP), new labour licence and calling visa have also, to a certain degree, contributed to the delay in employing foreign workers,” he said in a statement issued in connection with a visit conducted by Soppoa members to State Secretary Dato Sri Mohamad Abu Bakar Marzuki at Wisma Bapa Malaysia here recently.

20.08.2022,"20.08.2022 (www.thestar.com.my) -  KUALA LUMPUR: The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives is expected to trend downward next week on profit-taking activities.
Interband Group of Companies senior palm oil trader Jim Teh said the price movement next week is expected to confine between RM3,200 and RM3,700 per tonne.
""The lower forecast is mainly due to July’s high CPO stock in Malaysia and Indonesia. Demand is so-so (neither very good nor very bad),"" he told Bernama.
The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), in its report released on Aug 10, revealed Malaysia’s CPO stocks for July 2022 rose 2.79 per cent to 905,946 tonnes from 881,315 tonnes recorded in June 2022.
Overall, palm oil stocks increased 7.71 per cent to 1.77 million tonnes from 1.65 million tonnes in the preceding month.
He added that world uncertainties like Ukraine's war and increasing worries about global economic slowdown coupled with inflation and recession concerns have led to performance declines in most commodity markets, including the CPO.
Meanwhile, palm oil trader David Ng is a bit bullish in his projection of the CPO futures which he expects to trade between RM3,900 and RM4,200 per tonne.
He foresees the CPO futures to trend with upside bias given the bargain buying activities amid the weaker ringgit against the US dollar and the expectation of stronger exports in the coming weeks.
On a Friday-to-Friday basis, the spot month September 2022 decreased RM315 to RM4,090 a tonne, October 2022 lost RM306 to RM4,101 a tonne, November 2022 was RM318 lower at RM4,093 a tonne, and December 2022 declined RM329 to RM4,103 a tonne.
January 2023 was down by RM342 to RM4,132 and February 2023 eased RM339 to RM4,181 a tonne.
Total volume slid to 278,307 lots from 284,000 lots in the previous week, while open interest narrowed to 183,505 contracts from 191,133 contracts previously.

Mumbai-based Sunvin Group commodity research head Anilkumar Bagani said the better soybean oil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was driven by strong pullback from crucial support zone in crude oil on Thursday.
""The weaker ringgit against the US dollar is also seen to be supportive to the local CPO as it makes palm oil cheaper in the international markets.
""The CPO volumes on BMD have been lower this week and it increases the illiquidity with a wider difference in bid or ask values, resulting in volatility,"" he told Bernama.
He also shared that local CPO was trading at a discount of US$519 over CBOT soybean oils and at a discount of US$119 per tonne over gas oil.
At the close, CPO futures contract for spot month September 2022 increased by RM31 to RM4,090 a tonne, October 2022 added RM55 to RM4,101 a tonne, November 2022 was RM50 higher at RM4,093 a tonne, and December 2022 improved RM52 to RM4,103 a tonne.

19/08/2022,"19/08/2022 (The Edge Markets) - The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives closed lower on Thursday, weighed by ongoing concerns over rising production and lower soybean oil prices, a dealer said.
Palm oil trader David Ng said those factors continued to pressure the CPO market performance on Thursday.
""The Malaysian Palm Oil Association will be releasing the CPO production data by early next week. CPO production is expected to rise due to the seasonal period,"" he told Bernama, adding support was spotted at RM3,800 a tonne and resistance at RM4,400 a tonne.
Meanwhile, Mumbai-based Sunvin Group commodity research head Anilkumar Bagani said the persistent weakness in soybean oil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Crude Degummed Soybean Oil outright prices at South American free on board markets added further pressure on palm oil.
""The market however gets some support with the reduction in Malaysian palm oil export tax for September, which brought local palm oil prices neck and neck with the Indonesian palm oil offerings.
""Next crucial data would be Aug 1-20 palm oil export by cargo surveyors, followed by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board and Southern Peninsula Palm Oil Millers' Association production numbers,"" he told Bernama.
He also shared that Bursa Malaysia's CPO traded at discount of US$531 over CBOT soybean oils and at a discount of US$140 per tonne over gas oil.

In a statement, MPIC said all Accredited Certification Bodies (ACB) are going through the accreditation process with the Department of Standards Malaysia.
It noted that the list of ACB for MSPOMS2530:2022 could be found on MPOCC’s website.
""This is necessary to ensure that certification bodies that conduct audits under the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification scheme are competent to carry out credible and consistent audits,” it said an a statement.
MPOCC reiterated that palm oil processing facilities and dealers could voluntarily apply for MSPO certification under the MS2530:2022 Part 4.2 and 4.3 until the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) announces the mandatory implementation.
However, the MSPO certification has not been made mandatory for palm oil processing facilities and dealers.
The MSPO standard MS2530:2022 is the new version launched on March 22, 2022, with the new parts of MSPO standard which are Part 4.2 for palm oil processing facilities and Part 4.3 for dealers.
Previously, the standard’s version was known as MS2530:2013. - Bernama

19/08/2022,"19/08/2022 (Hellenic Shipping News) - Malaysian palm oil futures extended gains on Wednesday after the world’s second-largest producer lowered its exports tax reference price, but gains were capped by demand concerns.
The benchmark palm oil contract FCPOc3 for November delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange gained 45 ringgit, or 1.08%, to 4,227 ringgit ($946.70) a tonne by the midday break.
Malaysia has maintained its September export tax for crude palm oil at 8% and lowered its reference price, a circular on the Malaysian Palm Oil Board website showed on Wednesday.
The ringgit MYR=, palm’s currency of trade hovered near its lowest in more than five years, making the commodity cheaper for holders of foreign currency.
However, falling crude prices, concerns of lower demand, and bleak economic data in leading economies like China and the United States weighed, said Sandeep Singh, director of The Farm Trade, a Kuala Lumpur-based consulting and trading firm.
Dalian’s most-active soyoil contract DBYcv1 gained 0.8%, while its palm oil contract DCPcv1 rose 0.09%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade BOcv1 were up 0.7%.
Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.

19/08/2022,"19/08/2022 (The Star Online), Petaling Jaya - Analysts are mixed over Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd’s (KLK) fourth quarter (4Q) outlook, as the company could see higher sales from its plantation segment as well as weaker product prices.
RHB Research expects KLK to record improvements in sales volumes in 4Q due to the upliftment of the export ban in Indonesia and inventory normalisation.
KLK’s fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production for the nine months ended June 30 (9M22) increased by 26.28% year-on-year (y-o-y), which is higher than management’s growth guidance of 20% growth and RHB Research 22% growth assumption.”
The research house added that KLK’s 9M22 core net profit came in above estimates.
“This was mainly contributed by higher-than-expected FFB growth which led to lower than expected unit costs, as well as higher than expected palm kernel prices and property division earnings,” RHB said.
Kenanga Research meanwhile expects KLK’s earnings from the plantation business to ease as crude palm oil (CPO) prices have dipped by over 30% since June. It said this was due to a combination of seasonal supply uptrend and aggressive selling as Indonesia faces storage limitations.
“Despite seasonal supply improvement over the next few months, edible oil tightness is likely to ease only in 2023, provided demand recovery is not stronger than 3% to 4% y-o-y.
 “An economic slowdown or recession can dampen demand but we suspect buying should pick up as inventories among key buying countries are low,” Kenanga Research said.
Additionally, it said year-to-date Chinese imports of palm oil have been subdued while elevated fossil fuel prices meant that there is latent demand for biofuels. “We are maintaining an average CPO price of RM4,500 per tonne for FY22 and RM4,000 per tonne for FY23 but we are nudging down KLK’ s FY22 FFB production by 2%,” the research house said.
RHB estimates a drop in KLK’s unit costs in 9M22, given the y-o-y decline in plantation division revenue of 37% versus the y-o-y rise in pre-tax profit of 63%.
“This could be attributed to the strong FFB output as well as lower-than-normal fertilisation activities. Management estimates FY22 production unit cost to remain at RM2,000 per tonne as the increase in fertiliser costs will not be reflected fully in FY22, since the prices of fertilisers tendered for 1H22 were manageable,” said RHB Research.

18/08/2022,"18/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Jakarta - Indonesian diplomatic circles, media and political analysts view Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob as a prudent and pragmatic leader in his efforts to strengthen bilateral economic, social and cultural ties between Malaysia and Indonesia.
In a short span of 12 months since he took office as the 9th Prime Minister of Malaysia, Ismail Sabri’s efforts have been nothing short of encouraging.
Efforts to open a new chapter for both neighbouring countries commenced with his maiden visit to Jakarta in his official capacity as PM on November 10, 2021, with a meeting with President Joko Widodo.
“To us, Indonesia-Malaysia relations, which are likened to sibling relations, have been handled by PM Ismail very well so far and the peoples of both countries continue to enjoy strong ties,” remarked political and communication analyst Hendri Satrio when commenting on the ties which span 65 years.
Negative sentiments surfaced for a while when Indonesia halted the entry of its people to Malaysia in July following a remark by Malaysia about its sources of labour from 15 countries to choose from but the whole issue was amicably resolved, he noted.
Now, with all misunderstandings clarified and cleared, Satrio, who is with Paramadina University in Jakarta, observed that ""Indonesia has a very friendly relationship with Malaysia at the moment.""
He was commenting on Ismail Sabri’s performance since he took up the helm of leadership in Malaysia in August 2021.
The Malaysian-Indonesian Journalists’ Association (ISWAMI) also recognised the new leader’s commitment to improving bilateral ties.
Its president Asro Kamal Rokan commented that, in maintaining political harmony in Malaysia, Ismail Sabri held an added advantage as a leader who kept to his promises.
“Having been appointed as a PM during unstable political conditions during which the country witnessed a change in PM three times within three years, Ismail Sabri is now a year into his role with a relatively stable political situation. 
Asro also admired his determination to make Malaysian Journalists’ Day (HAWANA) a success following a meeting with 17 editors of key Indonesian media houses last year.
“That promise was fulfilled by the Prime Minister in Melaka on May 29 this year.”
The following day, Asro and 15 other senior editors and ISWAMI management were invited to a luncheon with Ismail Sabri in Putrajaya where they were feted to some “durian diplomacy”.
Meanwhile, Charge d’affaires of the Malaysian Embassy in Indonesia Adlan Mohd Shaffieq said Ismail Sabri’s two visits to Jakarta within a span of four months have lifted the relationship to a higher level.
Under Ismail Sabri’s helm, the long-delayed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the placement and protection of Indonesian domestic workers was finally inked.
“His visit to the Indonesian military equipment production facility PT Pindad in Bandung last year has been instrumental in bilateral defence cooperation for which an MoU was signed last week.”
Malaysia-Indonesia bilateral ties have flourished in key sectors namely economic, education, health, and tourism, as well as tackling the negative narrative towards palm oil.
“The good ties between both countries will enable companies in Malaysia to make inroads in Indonesia and vice versa,” he added.

In a short span of 12 months since he took office as the 9th Prime Minister of Malaysia, Ismail Sabri’s efforts have been nothing short of encouraging.
Efforts to open a new chapter for both neighbouring countries commenced with his maiden visit to Jakarta in his official capacity as PM on November 10, 2021, with a meeting with President Joko Widodo.
“To us, Indonesia-Malaysia relations, which are likened to sibling relations, have been handled by PM Ismail very well so far and the peoples of both countries continue to enjoy strong ties,” remarked political and communication analyst Hendri Satrio when commenting on the ties which span 65 years.
Negative sentiments surfaced for a while when Indonesia halted the entry of its people to Malaysia in July following a remark by Malaysia about its sources of labour from 15 countries to choose from but the whole issue was amicably resolved, he noted.
Now, with all misunderstandings clarified and cleared, Satrio, who is with Paramadina University in Jakarta, observed that ""Indonesia has a very friendly relationship with Malaysia at the moment.""
He was commenting on Ismail Sabri’s performance since he took up the helm of leadership in Malaysia in August 2021.
The Malaysian-Indonesian Journalists’ Association (ISWAMI) also recognised the new leader’s commitment to improving bilateral ties.
Its president Asro Kamal Rokan commented that, in maintaining political harmony in Malaysia, Ismail Sabri held an added advantage as a leader who kept to his promises.
“Having been appointed as a PM during unstable political conditions during which the country witnessed a change in PM three times within three years, Ismail Sabri is now a year into his role with a relatively stable political situation. 
Asro also admired his determination to make Malaysian Journalists’ Day (HAWANA) a success following a meeting with 17 editors of key Indonesian media houses last year.
“That promise was fulfilled by the Prime Minister in Melaka on May 29 this year.”
The following day, Asro and 15 other senior editors and ISWAMI management were invited to a luncheon with Ismail Sabri in Putrajaya where they were feted to some “durian diplomacy”.
Meanwhile, Charge d’affaires of the Malaysian Embassy in Indonesia Adlan Mohd Shaffieq said Ismail Sabri’s two visits to Jakarta within a span of four months have lifted the relationship to a higher level.
Under Ismail Sabri’s helm, the long-delayed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the placement and protection of Indonesian domestic workers was finally inked.
“His visit to the Indonesian military equipment production facility PT Pindad in Bandung last year has been instrumental in bilateral defence cooperation for which an MoU was signed last week.”
Malaysia-Indonesia bilateral ties have flourished in key sectors namely economic, education, health, and tourism, as well as tackling the negative narrative towards palm oil.
“The good ties between both countries will enable companies in Malaysia to make inroads in Indonesia and vice versa,” he added.

18/08/2022,"18/08/2022 (The Star Online), Petaling Jaya - Palm oil climbed for a second straight day as a gain in rival soybean oil prices boosted the tropical oil’s appeal.
Futures for November delivery climbed as much as 1.6% to RM4,250, before closing at RM4,200 in Kuala Lumpur. Soybean oil, palm’s closest substitute, rose as much as 1% in Chicago to snap two days of losses.
“Palm oil is being helped by external markets,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, head of trading and hedging strategies at Kaleesuwari Intercontinental.
Dryness has gripped parts of the US Midwest, threatening the soy crop during a critical stage of growth. While some rain relief is likely this week, this month’s weather remains vital to determining the ultimate size of the US harvest.
“However, the palm oil market lacks fundamental strength, which explains why it is struggling to maintain gains.
“Technically, prices are expected to hover between RM3,975 and RM4,500 in the short term,” Thiagarajan said.
Investors will be tracking exports from Malaysia, the second-biggest grower, as it’s an indicator of overseas demand.
Shipments fell 1.9% in the first half of August from a month earlier, according to AmSpec Agri. Purchases by India, the top importer, may pick up during the festival season that ends with Diwali in late October. — Bloomberg

18/08/2022,"18/08/2022 (The Edge Market), Kuala Lumpur - The Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) has concluded its Palm Oil Trade Fairs and Seminar (POTS) in the Philippines (POTS Philippines 2022) on Wednesday (Aug 17).
In a statement, MPOC said POTS Philippines 2022 is aimed at bringing together reputable Malaysian palm oil industry players to meet with existing and potential users of palm oil in the Philippines from various sectors, with the aim of developing long and successful business relations. 
Speakers at the one-day seminar were prominent local industry captains and international experts from Malaysia, Europe and the Philippines.
In her keynote address, Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin highlighted the significance of the Philippines as a trade partner and important user of Malaysian palm oil.
“The Philippines is the sixth largest importer of Malaysian palm oil in 2021. With an import volume recorded at almost 580,000 tonnes in 2021, it is a testimony that the Philippines is very important to the Malaysian palm oil industry,” she said.
Palm oil is the major oil consumed in the Philippines, followed by locally-produced coconut oil, accounting for 77% of the total usage of all oils and fats.
Zuraida said POTS Philippines provides a valuable platform for those in the oils and fats business to meet and explore not only business collaborations and opportunities, but also establish trade partnerships.
She expressed confidence that the event would widen collaborations between Malaysian and the Philippines' oils and fats industry players.
“This event offers the business communities, particularly from Malaysia, [the opportunity] to synergise and strengthen existing partnerships that have been nurtured over the years, as well as explore new potential for cooperation,” she added.
Themed “Addressing Philippines’ Oils and Fats Diversity Through Malaysian Palm Oil”, POTS Philippines 2022 aspires to establish and continue to complement the Philippines’ growing oils and fats needs, stemming from the country’s rapid economic growth.

17/08/2022,"17/08/2022 (The Star Online) - Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) expects weaker palm oil prices, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures from higher priced fuels, fertilisers and agrochemicals to impact its plantation and manufacturing segments in the fourth quarter (4Q) after posting strong 3Q financial results.
KLK’s revenue for 3Q ended June 30, 2022 rose to RM6.96bil from RM5.17bil in 3Q of financial year 2021 (FY21) on higher contribution from its plantation business which enjoyed higher prices for its crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK) oil.
Net profit for the period dipped 29% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM558.3mil or an earnings per share (EPS) of 51.8 sen primarily due to 3Q of FY21 having factored in gains on disposal of an associate company, Aura Muhibah Sdn Bhd.
“Excluding the above non-operational gains, the group’s current quarter pre-tax profit would be 20.4% higher at RM753.7mil compared with RM626.1mil in 3Q of FY21, supported by the increase in revenue,” KLK said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday.
The group’s plantation segment reported a substantial increase in profit to RM594.3mil in the quarter as compared with RM402.9mil in 3Q of FY21 driven by higher CPO and PK prices, profit contribution from recently acquired subsidiaries and a higher unrealised gain of RM86.7mil from fair value changes on outstanding derivative contracts.
It is to note that the unrealised gain in 3Q of FY21 stood significantly lower at RM18.7mil.
“This segment’s profit was partially offset by higher CPO production cost and fair value loss of RM56.4mil on a valuation of unharvested fresh fruit bunches,” the group said.
KLK’s manufacturing segment saw net profit slipping 11.9% y-o-y to RM208.9mil in the quarter despite a 33.4% increase in revenue to RM5.86bil.
“The higher profit contribution from the oleochemical division was partially offset by losses from refineries and kernel crushing operations and a higher unrealised loss of RM33.7mil from fair value changes on outstanding derivative contracts,” the group added.
For the nine-month period, revenue surged to RM20.17bil versus RM13.98bil in the nine-month period of FY21, while net profit increased 4% y-o-y to RM1.7bil or an EPS of 158 sen.
KLK said profits from its plantation segment will sustain despite CPO and PK prices easing following an increase of 41% and 40.9% to RM4,857 and RM3,364 per tonne respectively in 3Q of FY22.
Its manufacturing segment’s performance will be satisfactory, supported by its ability to consistently deliver high-quality and sustainably produced ingredients in a tight supply environment.
“Overall, the group expects to deliver a favourable set of results for FY22,” KLK said.
Batu Kawan Bhd, which holds a 47.73%-stake in KLK, posted a higher revenue of RM7.25bil in the 3Q period compared with RM5.4bil in 3Q of FY21. Its net profit fell to RM304.3mil for the period versus RM386.47mil in 3Q of FY21.
Batu Kawan’s nine-month revenue and net profit surged 44.3% y-o-y and 13.4% y-o-y to RM21bil and RM951.56mil, respectively, driven by higher palm product prices.
KLK closed 2.4% higher at RM23 per share yesterday, while Batu Kawan’s shares were up marginally by 0.33% to RM23.98 per share.

16/08/2022,"16/08/2022 (Mongabay), Jakarta - Smallholder farmers in Sumatra who cultivate oil palms are more likely to expand their farms into carbon-rich peat forests the closer they are to roads and palm oil mills, a new study finds.
The study by researchers from the University of Maryland in the U.S. and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore looked at the spatial distribution and drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion into peat forests in the Indonesian province of Riau.
Riau has both the second-largest area of peatland in Indonesia and the highest palm oil production of any province in the country, with a rapid rate of expansion of smallholder farms.
This expansion has come at the expense of natural ecosystems, as farmers drain and clear peat swamp forests, a practice that releases large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change.
The researchers wanted to know what factors drive small farmers to clear peat swamp forests, given the dearth of research on the issue, especially for independent farmers cultivating plots smaller than 25 hectares (62 acres). The lack of data is also jarring given that smallholders manage nearly half of the total oil palm plantation area in Indonesia.
Jing Zhao, the study’s lead author and an agricultural economist at the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science, said this gap might be due to the fact that smallholders’ expansion came later than the initial spurt of growth of industrial oil palm estates.
“[A]lso, ‘smallholders’ are by definition small individually and often widely scattered,” Zhao told Mongabay. “People may not realize that there is such a large amount of smallholder oil palm on peatland now and it is difficult to get data about smallholder oil palm.”
The researchers say the study is the first of its kind to use remote sensing and spatial data to identify drivers of smallholder expansion into peatland. It focused on oil palm smallholders operating on land that used to be peat swamp forest in 1990.
The researchers found that distance to roads and mills plays a critical role in driving this expansion. The odds of a given area of peat swamp forest being cleared for smallholder oil palm declined rapidly with increasing distance from roads and mills, according to the study.
For every kilometer increase in distance to the nearest road, the odds of peat forest conversion fell by 59%, and by 7% for every kilometer increase from the nearest mill, the study’s findings show.
It also found the spatial patterns of smallholder oil palm cultivation to be distinct from those of industrial oil palm plantations.
Since 1990 in Riau, 75% of smallholder oil palm farms that expanded into peat swamp forest were located within 1 kilometer (0.6 mi) of a roads; 90% were located within 2 km (1.2) of a road and 25 km (15 mi) of a mill, according to the study.
And for all land within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of a road, smallholder oil palm accounted for the majority of land cover, the study shows.
It also found the mean distance from smallholder oil palms to the nearest road (722 ± 806 meters) is much shorter than for industrial oil palm estates (1,292 ± 1,330 m).
All these show “how dependent palm oil-producing smallholders are on road access,” Zhao said.
The crucial role that road access plays in smallholder expansion boils down to the nature of oil palm production, where timing is everything. When farmers harvest the palm fruit from the trees, they have to get it processed within 48 hours, otherwise the quality of the oil breaks down due to the effects of enzymes and oxidation.
“[B]ut smallholders generally do not have the means to transport their own goods to processing mills,” Zhao said. “Better access to roads benefits smallholders by reducing marketing and transportation costs thereby facilitating production and consequently improving socioeconomic conditions for smallholders.”
In addition to roads and mills, zoning factors such as the location of concessions and migrant settlements, and environmental factors such as precipitation and elevation, are important drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion into peatland, the study found.
It showed that smallholder oil palm farms are more likely to be located in regions with higher precipitation, higher slopes and lower elevation compared to other land cover types. It also found that the presence of concessions, typically held by industrial plantation companies, significantly restrict smallholder oil palm expansion.
According to the study, only around 50,000 hectares (123,600 acres) of smallholder oil palms, or 30% of smallholdings in Riau, were located inside oil palm concessions, while about 21,700 hectares (53,600 acres), or 14%, were inside pulpwood concessions.
When oil palm concessions are established, the odds of the peat areas inside them being converted into smallholder oil palm are about 77% lower than the odds outside concessions, the study found. Inside pulpwood concessions, the odds are 52% lower than outside them.
The researchers said smallholder oil palms usually don’t exist inside concessions because “the company would maximize the concession area for their own industrial plantations.’
Conservation opportunities
By understanding the drivers of smallholder expansion, the researchers said, stakeholders can identify strategies for slowing the deforestation of the remaining peat swamp forests in Riau and across Sumatra.
“Such knowledge is important in guiding future decisions for road infrastructure planning and forest conservation,” Zhao said.
This is especially important because even though Riau has lost much of its peat swamp forests, up to 70% since 1990,  nearly a third of peat swamp forests areas remain, spanning some 940,000 hectares (2.3 million acres).
“By accounting for the settlement patterns of smallholder farmers, both inside and outside concessions, unintended negative consequences for the conservation of the remaining peat swamp forests can be avoided,” the researchers said.
To make conservation efforts more focused and effective, the researchers identified regions that are at high risk of further conversion to smallholder oil palm plantations, determined from their distance to roads and mills. The researchers found 291,755 hectares (720,942 acres) of remaining peat swamp forest to be at high risk. Of these, 29,470 hectares (72,822 acres) are located within 2 km of roads and 25 km of mills, while 66,598 hectares (164,567 acres) are located within 2 km of a road, and 195,687 hectares (483,553 acres) are located within 25 km of a mill.
“Government should give more priorities in protecting these high risk areas,” Zhao said. “In addition, future roads and mills should be kept at a certain distance away from the remaining peatlands in order to limit oil palm expansion.”
To protect these high-risk areas, the government could designate them as protected areas, or place them under an existing moratorium on clearing peatland, the researchers said. The government could also expand its services in these high-risk areas to help smallholders identify effective ways to increase their income other than by clearing peat forests for oil palms. This could include efforts to improve yields and production from existing farmland, the researchers added.
There’s also a need for clear and updated concession boundaries, given that more than 30% of the remaining peat swamp forests lie within concessions, according to the researchers.
“Moreover, remaining peat swamp forests inside concessions could be used to generate carbon credits, if international carbon markets become well enough developed,” the researchers said.

By understanding the drivers of smallholder expansion, the researchers said, stakeholders can identify strategies for slowing the deforestation of the remaining peat swamp forests in Riau and across Sumatra.
“Such knowledge is important in guiding future decisions for road infrastructure planning and forest conservation,” Zhao said.
This is especially important because even though Riau has lost much of its peat swamp forests, up to 70% since 1990,  nearly a third of peat swamp forests areas remain, spanning some 940,000 hectares (2.3 million acres).
“By accounting for the settlement patterns of smallholder farmers, both inside and outside concessions, unintended negative consequences for the conservation of the remaining peat swamp forests can be avoided,” the researchers said.
To make conservation efforts more focused and effective, the researchers identified regions that are at high risk of further conversion to smallholder oil palm plantations, determined from their distance to roads and mills. The researchers found 291,755 hectares (720,942 acres) of remaining peat swamp forest to be at high risk. Of these, 29,470 hectares (72,822 acres) are located within 2 km of roads and 25 km of mills, while 66,598 hectares (164,567 acres) are located within 2 km of a road, and 195,687 hectares (483,553 acres) are located within 25 km of a mill.
“Government should give more priorities in protecting these high risk areas,” Zhao said. “In addition, future roads and mills should be kept at a certain distance away from the remaining peatlands in order to limit oil palm expansion.”
To protect these high-risk areas, the government could designate them as protected areas, or place them under an existing moratorium on clearing peatland, the researchers said. The government could also expand its services in these high-risk areas to help smallholders identify effective ways to increase their income other than by clearing peat forests for oil palms. This could include efforts to improve yields and production from existing farmland, the researchers added.
There’s also a need for clear and updated concession boundaries, given that more than 30% of the remaining peat swamp forests lie within concessions, according to the researchers.
“Moreover, remaining peat swamp forests inside concessions could be used to generate carbon credits, if international carbon markets become well enough developed,” the researchers said.

16/08/2022,"16/08/2022 (Mongabay), Jakarta - Smallholder farmers in Sumatra who cultivate oil palms are more likely to expand their farms into carbon-rich peat forests the closer they are to roads and palm oil mills, a new study finds.
The study by researchers from the University of Maryland in the U.S. and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore looked at the spatial distribution and drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion into peat forests in the Indonesian province of Riau.
Riau has both the second-largest area of peatland in Indonesia and the highest palm oil production of any province in the country, with a rapid rate of expansion of smallholder farms.
This expansion has come at the expense of natural ecosystems, as farmers drain and clear peat swamp forests, a practice that releases large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change.
The researchers wanted to know what factors drive small farmers to clear peat swamp forests, given the dearth of research on the issue, especially for independent farmers cultivating plots smaller than 25 hectares (62 acres). The lack of data is also jarring given that smallholders manage nearly half of the total oil palm plantation area in Indonesia.
Jing Zhao, the study’s lead author and an agricultural economist at the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science, said this gap might be due to the fact that smallholders’ expansion came later than the initial spurt of growth of industrial oil palm estates.
“[A]lso, ‘smallholders’ are by definition small individually and often widely scattered,” Zhao told Mongabay. “People may not realize that there is such a large amount of smallholder oil palm on peatland now and it is difficult to get data about smallholder oil palm.”
The researchers say the study is the first of its kind to use remote sensing and spatial data to identify drivers of smallholder expansion into peatland. It focused on oil palm smallholders operating on land that used to be peat swamp forest in 1990.
The researchers found that distance to roads and mills plays a critical role in driving this expansion. The odds of a given area of peat swamp forest being cleared for smallholder oil palm declined rapidly with increasing distance from roads and mills, according to the study.
For every kilometer increase in distance to the nearest road, the odds of peat forest conversion fell by 59%, and by 7% for every kilometer increase from the nearest mill, the study’s findings show.
It also found the spatial patterns of smallholder oil palm cultivation to be distinct from those of industrial oil palm plantations.
Since 1990 in Riau, 75% of smallholder oil palm farms that expanded into peat swamp forest were located within 1 kilometer (0.6 mi) of a roads; 90% were located within 2 km (1.2) of a road and 25 km (15 mi) of a mill, according to the study.
And for all land within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of a road, smallholder oil palm accounted for the majority of land cover, the study shows.
It also found the mean distance from smallholder oil palms to the nearest road (722 ± 806 meters) is much shorter than for industrial oil palm estates (1,292 ± 1,330 m).
All these show “how dependent palm oil-producing smallholders are on road access,” Zhao said.
The crucial role that road access plays in smallholder expansion boils down to the nature of oil palm production, where timing is everything. When farmers harvest the palm fruit from the trees, they have to get it processed within 48 hours, otherwise the quality of the oil breaks down due to the effects of enzymes and oxidation.
“[B]ut smallholders generally do not have the means to transport their own goods to processing mills,” Zhao said. “Better access to roads benefits smallholders by reducing marketing and transportation costs thereby facilitating production and consequently improving socioeconomic conditions for smallholders.”
In addition to roads and mills, zoning factors such as the location of concessions and migrant settlements, and environmental factors such as precipitation and elevation, are important drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion into peatland, the study found.
It showed that smallholder oil palm farms are more likely to be located in regions with higher precipitation, higher slopes and lower elevation compared to other land cover types. It also found that the presence of concessions, typically held by industrial plantation companies, significantly restrict smallholder oil palm expansion.
According to the study, only around 50,000 hectares (123,600 acres) of smallholder oil palms, or 30% of smallholdings in Riau, were located inside oil palm concessions, while about 21,700 hectares (53,600 acres), or 14%, were inside pulpwood concessions.
When oil palm concessions are established, the odds of the peat areas inside them being converted into smallholder oil palm are about 77% lower than the odds outside concessions, the study found. Inside pulpwood concessions, the odds are 52% lower than outside them.
The researchers said smallholder oil palms usually don’t exist inside concessions because “the company would maximize the concession area for their own industrial plantations.’

16/08/2022,"16/08/2022 (Business Recorder), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysian palm oil futures rose more than 3% on Tuesday after falling to their worst session in a month, as the ringgit hit its lowest in five-and-a-half years, making the vegetable oil cheaper for buyers holding other currencies.
The benchmark palm oil contract for November delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange had gained 134 ringgit, or 3.24%, to 4,272 ringgit ($957.20) a tonne by the midday break.
On Monday, the contract fell 6.4% on lacklustre August exports data and weaker crude oil prices.
A widening discount between crude palm oil and soybean oil, now at about $520 per tonne, and the weakening ringgit have spurred demand, Refinitiv Commodities Research said in a note late on Monday. The ringgit fell 0.13% against the dollar to hit its lowest since January 2017.
The currency has weakened around 7% so far this year.
Palm oil to hover below 4,452 ringgit
The market was also supported by short-covering and technical buying after prices managed to stay above 4,100 ringgit, a Kuala Lumpur-based trader said.
Exports of Malaysian palm oil products for Aug. 1-15 fell 9.5% to 516,072 tonnes from the same period in July, cargo surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance said.
Dalian’s most-active soyoil contract fell 0.6%, while its palm oil contract lost 0.4%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade were up 0.05%.
Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.
Palm oil looks neutral in a narrow range of 4,085 ringgit to 4,269 ringgit per tonne, and an escape could suggest a direction, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said.

16/08/2022,"16/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - Fima Corp Bhd's net profit for the first quarter ended June 30, 2022 (1QFY23) surged more than four-fold to RM11.55 million from RM2.34 million, in line with higher revenue contributions mainly from oil palm production and processing, and the production and trading of security and confidential documents.
Earnings per share amounted to 4.87 sen from 0.98 sen before, according to a Bursa Malaysia filing on Tuesday (Aug 16).
Quarterly revenue grew 92.58% to RM74.33 million from RM38.6 million due to higher sales recorded by all of the group's divisions.
Fima said revenue from its production and trading of security and confidential documents division was 126.3% or RM16.6 million higher against the corresponding period last year mainly due to higher sales volume for travel documents.
As for its oil palm production and processing segment, Fima said the division registered RM18.9 million or 78.5% increase in revenue compared with the corresponding period last year, primarily due to higher sales volumes and prices of crude palm oil and crude palm kernel oil.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Fima's net profit plunged by 58.15% from RM27.61 million in the immediate preceding quarter while revenue fell by 19.18% from RM91.98 million in 4QFY22.
Looking ahead, Fima said it will continue to focus on establishing new strategic alliances to develop new products and solutions to complement its existing products for the production and trading of security and confidential documents segment.
The group foresees the overall performance of the oil palm production and processing segment remaining very much influenced by the direction of palm oil prices and estate yield.
Fima's share price closed unchanged at RM1.94 on Tuesday, valuing the company at RM475.8 million.

17/08/2022,"17/08/2022 (Nagaland) - State government has terminated the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Andhra Pradesh-based M/s Shivasais Oil Palm Private Limited, which was signed in 2014, after the company failed to set up collection centres within the allotted clusters and purchase fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) from the farmers before setting up the mill.
Informing this to Nagaland Post, the Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC) Nagaland, Y Kikheto Sema, said the signing of the MoU was intended to enhance the income of the farming community considering the massive unused land in the state. APC said the land was supposed to be utilized for plantations of oil palm in a large scale, which would be a ready raw material feeder for oil palm manufacturing units.
Sema said the Centre had also earmarked Rs.11,040 crore to take up palm oil plantation under the National Mission on Edible oils with special focus on North East. However, with the termination of MoU, he said that has ceased in the state.
APC said that the next step of the directorate is to create a convincing proposal with clear guidelines besides creating awareness of the oil palm among the farmers and letting them come forward it they were willing to take up the plantation.
With Jhum as integral practice in the state, APC Kikhteo said that the degraded land could be made good use through oil palm cultivation.
He informed that the actual coverage area at the initial part was 2,50,000 ha, but was reduced to 15,000 ha under oil palm plantations due to a lack of good nurseries. However, APC said that to meet the demands of the farming community, the reviewed area coverage was enhanced yet again.
During the on-the-spot verification by the officials of the department, he said it was observed that buy-back of the FFBs had not been completed and at the same time the department received complaint letters by the oil palm farmers.
It may be mentioned that in continuation of the first MoU signed on September 11, 2014, a second ancillary MoU for the four districts was signed on August 11, 2015.

16/08/2022,"16/08/2022 (China Daily) - Amid rising global commodity prices, Indonesia and Malaysia have expanded their exports, which has helped with recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to analysts.
Indonesia, the biggest economy of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, recorded GDP growth of 5.44 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, while Malaysia's GDP rose by 8.9 percent in the same period.
""Indonesia and Malaysia are among the few in the region which are net exporters of commodities, including agricultural, oil and gas, minerals and metals,"" said Radhika Rao, senior vice-president and economist at Singapore's DBS Bank.
Rao told China Daily that while global uncertainties have posed strong headwinds, the rise in commodity prices has been a ""key counterweight"" that boosted second-quarter growth in the two major exporting economies.
Nicholas Mapa, senior economist at ING, said the ""commodity price boom"" has been stabilizing Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, and reducing interest rates amid the interest rate hikes of the United States. This, he said, has limited the ""negative fallout associated with expensive imported food"".
The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has disrupted the global supply chain, brought mixed results to Indonesia and Malaysia. While their export revenues were up, both countries have also needed to contend with higher food prices, as they are both importers of wheat and corn.
For example, the two countries are exporters of palm oil. The surge in global vegetable oil prices, due to the tight sunflower oil supply from Ukraine, has raised Indonesian and Malaysian export revenues. The situation is the same regarding the two countries' exports of other commodities, including coal and natural gas.
Indonesia's exports in June surged more than 40 percent year-on-year to $26.09 billion, while Malaysia's exports expanded by 38.8 percent in June.
However, inflation, on the back of higher food prices, has reined in Indonesia's and Malaysia's growth prospects. Indonesia's inflation rose to a seven-year high of 4.94 percent in June, and Malaysia's inflation increased by 3.4 percent.
Wheat is widely used in Indonesia, where instant noodles are a staple, while Malaysia's poultry industry uses imported corn as feed.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said that the international prices of all the cereals represented in its Cereal Price Index fell in July, with global wheat prices, which fell by as much as 14.5 percent, leading the decline. Nevertheless, international wheat prices were still 24.8 percent above those of July last year, the FAO said.
Commodity prices remain elevated, according to Khor Yu Leng, regional economist at Singapore-based consultancy Segi Enam Advisors.
""Worried consumers have paid more for less, and recession fears have affected demand,"" Khor told China Daily. She said consumers will continue to have ""food inflation worries"" as they have to deal with higher grocery bills.
Rao, of DBS, said that high food costs are ""beginning to reflect in (the Indonesian and Malaysian) economies' inflation prints"". This is because food accounts for around 25 to 35 percent of the two countries' consumer price indexes.
The Indonesian government earlier banned palm oil exports to curb rising prices of cooking oil in the local market, and the Malaysian government has offered food subsidies and temporarily halted chicken exports to keep inflation at bay.
""Resumption in exports by Ukraine is a favorable development, but the impact on prices and availability is likely to entail some amount of gestation period, thus proving to have less of a calming impact on costs in the short term,"" Rao said.

16/08/2022,"16/08/2022 (ANTARA News), Jakarta - The National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) is developing alternative environmentally friendly energy sources, such as bioethanol for biofuels and hydrogen, to support the transition from fossil-based to clean energy to reduce carbon emissions.
“The National Research and Innovation Agency continues to conduct research and innovation to support the energy transition by utilizing alternative energy sources in Indonesia,"" head of BRIN’s Energy and Manufacturing Research Organization, Haznan Abimanyu, said on Tuesday.
The effort is in accordance with President Joko Widodo's speech at the 2022 annual session of the People's Consultative Assembly and the joint session of the House of Representatives and Regional Representatives Council here on Tuesday.
Abimanyu said that besides downstreaming, the optimization of clean energy sources and the green economy must be improved constantly.
President Joko Widodo said clean energy sourced from solar heat, geothermal, wind, ocean waves, and bioenergy will attract industrialization that produces low-emission products.
Reliance on fossil-based fuels has had an impact on climate change, thus clean energy has become an urgent need, both on the domestic and global fronts, Abimanyu said.
For the industrial sector, research on ecosystem innovations in carbon capture and storage systems, blue hydrogen and green hydrogen for the petrochemical industry, and biofuels in terms of bioenergy have become vital for protecting the ecosystem.
In the transportation sector, the government is preparing alternative eco-friendly fuels. Thus, the agency is conducting research and development of bioethanol and hydrogen as alternative environmentally friendly fuels.
Bioethanol is one of the biofuels that could be used as an additive and substitute or in blending for gasoline. In addition, research related to hydrogen as a fuel for transportation is being pursued as part of efforts to reduce emissions.
The agency's second generation (G2) bioethanol production pilot plant has managed to develop bioethanol with a purity of more than 99.6 percent.
The raw material for bioethanol G2 is lignocellulosic biomass from palm oil plantation waste in the form of empty palm oil bunches, which are currently the most abundant since Indonesia is the number one producer of palm oil in the world.
The use of ethanol as a fuel oil mixture could reduce 70–90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions compared to the equivalent of 90 octane fuel oil.
However, there are still many issues surrounding the use of bioethanol as a domestic fuel, specifically the physical properties of ethanol, the guarantee of raw material availability, and databases and energy balances, all of which need to be resolved.
The main expert researcher from BRIN’s Energy Conservation and Conversion Research Center, Eniya Listiani Dewi, said that one of the efforts to reduce emissions from the transportation sector is the use of battery-based and hydrogen gas-based electric vehicles.
The use of hydrogen-fueled vehicles is more suitable for long-distance transportation because hydrogen vehicles can go long distances with just one refueling.
The time required for hydrogen refueling is less than three minutes, just like for gasoline. However, currently, the hydrogen production infrastructure, including fueling stations, requires high investment.
Meanwhile, charging electric vehicles takes quite a long time. Even at fast charging stations, it can take up to 1.5 hours. Therefore, electric vehicles are more suitable for short-distance transportation.

15/08/2022,"15/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Jakarta - Palm oil tumbled from a six-week high following a decline in soybeans and on prospects of weakening demand in China.
Futures for October delivery fell 6.7% to close at RM4,113 a ton after ending last week at the highest level since July 1. Soybeans and soybean oil declined too, after the US Department of Agriculture forecast record domestic soy output.
Palm oil prices are pressured by profit-taking after strong gains last week, said Sathia Varqa, owner of Palm Oil Analytics in Singapore. There is also renewed concern over Chinese demand due to Covid-19 lockdowns, he added.
China's commitment to Covid-zero means the threat of repeated restrictions and reopenings continues to loom. August saw a surge in cases on the resort island of Hainan, where authorities have locked down holidaymakers, suspended flights, and shut businesses to contain infections.
Malaysian palm oil exports, a gauge of overseas demand, are showing signs of weakening. Shipments climbed 2.8% in the first half of August from the previous month, slowing from a 10.5% increase in the Aug 1-10 period, according to Intertek Testing Services.
Production and stockpiles are expected to rise in top growers Indonesia and Malaysia, which will likely weigh on prices, said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, head of trading and hedging strategies at Kaleesuwari Intercontinental.
The prospects for increasing sunflower oil supplies could also be bearish, he added. Two grain-loaded ships were authorised to leave Ukraine ports on Aug 13, including one carrying sunflower seeds for delivery to Turkey.

""They (palm farmers) can now sell more than the (palm) fresh fruit bunches. If (they produce) 10 tons (of red cooking oil) daily, we calculate the product can be distributed to two sub-districts outside the palm plantation, and this will enhance the distribution of red cooking oil (as an alternative to) cooking oil to residents,"" he said at the 2022 Indonesian Retail Summit on Monday.
The summit was organized by the Indonesia Retail and Tenant Association (Hippindo) at Sarinah Building here.
Speaking at the summit, the minister expressed his gratitude to the association for contributing to efforts to seek a market for red cooking oil.
Hippindo chairperson Budhihardjo has confirmed that the association has received a demand for 200 tons of red cooking oil from restaurant chains nationwide, he noted.
""We need not hesitate. We can build a mini-factory (to produce) CPO and red palm cooking oil for every one thousand hectares of palm plantation,"" the minister said.
Masduki also expressed his gratitude to State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir for supporting the development of the Palm Research Center (PPKS) in Medan, North Sumatra, to study the feasibility of red palm cooking oil as an alternative to cooking oil commonly used by residents.
""The 77th anniversary of Indonesia's independence is one of our momenta to make our palm farmers prosper and improve the supply of red cooking oil to residents, (maintain) its quality product because red cooking oil is more healthy, and we hope it will be more affordable because of its efficient production,"" he expounded.
Earlier, at a closed-door meeting with government ministers at the Presidential Palace on July 18, the minister confirmed that President Joko Widodo has agreed to the development of co-operatives-based red cooking oil development.
As co-operatives will be the basis of red cooking oil production, they will be able to directly purchase palm from farmers to produce crude palm oil and red palm cooking oil and market the finished products on their own, he explained.

15/08/2022,"15/08/2022 (Nairametrics) - Palm oil prices reached record highs in 2022, driven primarily by the disruption in the sunflower oil market caused by the Russia-Ukraine war and export restrictions imposed by the Indonesian government. Nigeria, though the fifth-largest producer of palm oil in the world, remains a net importer of the vegetable fat. Given that palm oil is widely used in cooking and manufacturing consumer food products in Nigeria, high prices have stoked consumer inflation and pushed the government to encourage local producers to meet the supply gap. While most of the palm oil is sourced from small farmers supplying to the local market, large producers, such as Presco and Okomu, are well placed to benefit from government support, strong international demand, and high prices.
Current local production is insufficient to meet domestic demand
Nigeria depends on palm oil imports from Southeast Asia, importing c.25% of palm oil consumed in recent years. Nigeria’s government is trying to reduce this supply shortfall and save valuable foreign exchange. Improved availability of palm oil will also likely encourage the expansion of the packaged food industry in Nigeria, providing a boost to the local economy. In addition, a historical preference for palm oil in cooking, a growing population and low per capita consumption of edible oils provide additional impetus for local production growth.
Palm oil should benefit from the government’s focus on export diversification
Nigeria is the largest economy by GDP and the most populous country in Africa. Despite being the largest consumer of palm oil in Africa in aggregate, the per capita consumption of edible oil remains relatively low. Focus on agricultural products, such as palm oil, gradually declined after the discovery of crude oil in the late 1950s, resulting in the current Nigerian export basket being dominated (c.90% of total exports) by crude oil and petroleum products. The Nigerian government aims to correct this dependence on oil exports. Palm oil is a key agricultural product where the country has the capability to restore its status as a global exporter. To support
local producers, the Nigerian government has introduced tariffs on palm oil imports and is lending financial support to local producers.

Mumbai-based Sunvin Group commodity research head Anilkumar Bagani said lower soybean oil futures, coupled with the weakness in crude oil has triggered profit-taking in local CPO futures.
“Soybean oil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was trading sharply lower in Asian hours on Monday.
“It has led to profit-taking activities in local market, after the last week surge to nearly RM4,500 per tonne for the benchmark October futures,” he told Bernama.

15/08/2022,"15/08/2022 (New Straits Times), Kuala Lumpur - Plantation owners have been encouraged to provide retraining and skills improvement to local workers and practice good labour management to ensure a sound long-term work force.
Plantation Industries and Commodities (MPIC) Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said a good labour force management policy will not only prevent foreign workers from absconding, but it will also enable employers to circumvent the risk of forced labour and human trafficking which can ultimately be disruptive to their export business.
""The MPIC takes cognisance of the concerns raised by the Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) in May this year that the Malaysian oil palm plantation sector could potentially be incurring losses of RM21 billion in 2021 and a further RM28 billion in 2022 if foreign workers are not brought into the country immediately,"" she said in a statement today.
The issue of the lack of foreign workers started following the closure of national borders due to the implementation of several stages of the Movement Control Order (MCO) when the Covid-19 pandemic peaked and worsened, affecting the harvesting process in farms across the country.
""The ministry at the same time also welcomes the agreement made by the Republic of Indonesia over the decision to re-allow the entry of its workers into Malaysia, which has been in effect since Aug 1, 2022, after withdrawing the restrictions before that, which were made due to concerns over issues related to rights of its (Indonesian) workers,"" she added.
She said the ministry will not compromise on issues related to forced labour in the country and Malaysia will continue to comply with the guidelines set in the International Labour Organisation (ILO).
""In fact, MPIC will continue to support the National Action Plan on Forced Labour (NAPFL) which was developed in an effort to address and eradicate the issue of forced labour in the country.""
She said that in order to simplify the process of hiring foreign workers, MPIC also acknowledged that the process must be complete and efficient.
""Hence, we are all looking forward to the coordination process to be gradually switched to a fully digitalised platform without any human interference possible.""
Zuraida said the ministry was confident that the noble efforts being undertaken at this time can help mobilise the 'Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil' campaign which, among other things, aims to explore and penetrate new markets and increase our country's palm oil exports.

13/08/2022,"13/08/2022 (The Star Online), Mumbai - India's palm oil imports in July fell 10% from a month ago, as refiners ramped up purchases of rival soyoil to take advantage of New Delhi's move to allow duty-free imports of the vegetable oil to calm all-time high prices, a trade body said on Friday.
Higher soyoil purchases by the world's biggest edible oil importer will support U.S. soyoil prices but will dent rival palm oil's share in Indian buying and force Malaysian and Indonesian sellers to offer discounts to regain the market share, traders said.
India's palm oil imports in July fell to 530,420 tonnes from 590,921 tonnes a month earlier, the Solvent Extractors' Association of India (SEA) said in a statement.
Soyoil imports in July jumped 125% from a month ago to a record 519,566 tonnes, while sunflower oil imports rose 30% to 155,300 tonnes.
India in late May allowed duty-free imports of 2 million tonnes each of soyoil and sunflower oil for the current and next fiscal years ending March 31, as part of efforts to keep a lid on local edible oil prices. 
Through the end of June, soy oil's premium over palm oil was less than $150 per tonne, but since palm oil attracts a 5.5% import tax, palm oil was effectively more expensive for Indian buyers, brokers said.
But again the gap between soyoil and palm oil has widened above $350 per tonne in the past few weeks, making palm oil purchases more attractive for refiners, the SEA said.
""In August, palm oil imports could rise above 700,000 tonnes. There was huge buying in July after prices were corrected,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.
Malaysian palm oil prices fell to their lowest in more than a year in July.

13/08/2022,"13/08/2022 (The Star Online), Kuala Lumpur - The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives is likely to trend higher next week on the expectation of higher palm oil export estimates by cargo surveyors, said a dealer.
""We expect next week's market to trade with an upward bias with the commodity’s price expected to trade between RM4,000 and RM4,600 per tonne due to the expectation of stronger exports,” palm oil trader David Ng told Bernama.
For the trading week just ended, Malaysian CPO futures were mostly higher, supported by gains in soybean oil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and stronger sentiment in global markets.
However, Malaysia is set to continue to see intense competition in the CPO market from Indonesia as the country will be flushing out its bloated inventory ahead of its seasonal peak production months.
Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) said initiatives announced by Indonesia recently are likely to boost its exports at the expense of Malaysia.
The Indonesian government announced that it will be raising its Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) requirement, reviewing its CPO reference price every two weeks instead of every month, as well as revising its export duty structure.
""As the August CPO reference price was also slashed to US$872.27 (US$1-RM4.44) per tonne, its export duty was drastically cut to US$52 per tonne from US$288 per tonne to help boost its exports. These measures are likely to boost Indonesia’s exports at the expense of Malaysia’s exports,” it said.
On a Friday-to-Friday basis, the spot month August 2022 gained RM412 to RM4,432 a tonne, September 2022 was RM482 higher at RM4,405 a tonne and October 2022 was up RM529 to RM4,407 a tonne.
November 2022 added RM532 to RM4,411 a tonne, December 2022 increased RM519 to RM4,432 a tonne and January 2023 rose RM508 to RM4,474 per tonne.

12/08/2022,"12/08/2022 (Business Recorder), Jakarta - Malaysian palm oil futures posted a weekly jump as prices rose for a second straight session on Friday, buoyed by signs of a pickup in demand from key buyers and gains in rival Dalian oils.
The benchmark palm oil contract for October delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange gained 3.66% to close at 4,420 ringgit ($994.94) per tonne. It posted a 13.98% gain for the week, rebounding from the previous week’s 9.6% drop.
“The market is still optimistic about demand,” a trader in Kuala Lumpur said, referring to growth in exports to main markets such as China, India and the European Union in the first 10 days of August.
Exports of Malaysian palm oil products for Aug. 1-10 rose about 10% monthly, cargo surveyor Intertek Testing Services and independent inspection company AmSpec Agri Malaysia said this week.
The bullish momentum on the Chicago Board of Trade and China’s vegetable oil futures helped palm rally amid short covering and bargain buying this week, said Anilkumar Bagani, research head of Mumbai-based vegetable oils broker Sunvin Group.
Palm rises on firmer rivals, August export data
“A significant recovery is being witnessed in palm oil prices for last couple of days as rally in CBOT soy oil gave space to palm oil to move higher, keeping its wide discount intact,” he said.
Dalian’s most-active soyoil contract was up 1.52%, while its palm oil contract rose 3.27%. Soyoil prices on CBOT were down 0.22% on Friday after a six-day rally.

10.08.2022,"10.08.2022 (en.tempo.co) - TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Indonesian Trade Ministry on Wednesday announced the reference price of crude palm oil (CPO) for the August 9-15 export duty stipulation at US$875.27 per metric ton (MT).
""The reference price decreased by US$743.56 or 46.02 percent from the July 2022 period, which was US$1,615.83 per MT,"" said Acting Director General of Foreign Trade Veri Anggrijono in an official statement, Wednesday, August 10.
The determination of the price is stated in the Decree of the Minister of Trade Number 1157 of 2022 concerning the Reference Price of Crude Palm Oil Subject to Export Duties and Service Tariffs of the Public Service Agency, the Palm Oil Plantation Fund Management Agency (BPDPKS).
In addition, it is also recorded in the Decree of the Minister of Trade Number 1159 of 2022 concerning the List of Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized (RBD) Palm Olein Brands in Branded Packaging and Packaged with a Net Weight of less than 25 kilograms for the period of August 2022.
""Currently, the CPO reference price has decreased and has begun to reach the threshold of $750 per MT,"" said Veri Anggrijono. For this reason, the government imposed a CPO export tax at $52 per MT for the period of August 2022, based on the Regulation of the Minister of Finance Number 123 PMK.010/22. This value decreased from CPO export tax for the period July 2022.
Veri explained that the decline in the CPO reference price was influenced by several factors, including the Indonesian government's policy in the form of a flush-out (FO) program, an increase in export quotas, and a zero percent CPO export levy valid until August 31, 2022.
The government's policy, he said, made Indonesia's exports increase so that the world's supply of CPO was getting better. The external effect of the decline in the CPO reference price, among others, is Malaysia's policy to stop CPO production due to a shortage of workers.
According to Veri, Russia's policy to lower the export tax on sunflower oil has also contributed to the decline in world CPO prices.

09/08/2022,"09/08/2022 (New Straits Times), Kuala Lumpur - Palm oil exports and palm oil-based products rose by 55.2 percent to RM67.48 billion between January and June this year from RM43.47 billion during the corresponding period in 2021.
Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said, of the value, 66.1 per cent of the export earnings were contributed by palm oil which amounted to RM44.63 billion compared with only RM28.8 billion in the same period last year.
""In terms of volume, the export of palm oil and palm oil-based products between January and June this year rose by 2.8 percent to 11.47 metric tonnes (MT) from 11.15 million MT a year ago.
""Malaysia recorded strong exports despite the drop in crude palm oil (CPO) production in the first half of 2022,"" she said in a statement.
Based on statistics by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), she said crude palm oil (CPO) production fell by 1.1 percent to 8.27 MT during the period compared with 8.36 metric tonnes during the same period in 2021.
The fall, she said was attributed to the dip in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield by 3.6 percent to 6.9 tonnes per hectare during the January-June 2022 period compared with 7.16 tonnes per hectare in the same period last year.
Meanwhile, the sharp rise in export earnings was partly due to the spike in CPO prices, both domestically and abroad.
Between January and June 2022, CPO prices rose by 55.9 percent to RM6,330 per MT from RM4,061.50 per MT during the same period in 2021.
According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), export earnings for palm oil and palm oil-based products between January and May this year rose to RM56.47 billion, or an increase of 58.8% compared with the five months in 2021.
""The ministry and I are pleased with the encouraging figures achieved during the first six months of 2022 as planters – both smallholders and listed plantation companies – were able to capitalise on the spike in CPO prices to generate higher revenue.
""Obviously, a surge in revenue that translates into better earnings is most welcomed as this would also contribute toward various sources of taxation that will ultimately enable the Keluarga Malaysia Government to carry out relevant socio-economic programmes that are deemed vital to expedite Malaysia's economic recovery from the economic fallout following the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Zuraida.
She said it was also gratifying to note that Malaysia's golden crop had gained wide global acceptance, as demonstrated by the encouraging export during the first half of 2022.
""We are confident that the prospects for Malaysian palm oil will remain bright during the second half of 2022. This is partly due to greater acceptance of the commodity globally, including that from non-traditional markets.
""We attribute this to the success of MPIC's campaign ""The Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil,"" which is intended to counter misinformation and false information on our number one commodity,"" she added.

09/08/2022,"09/08/2022 (Borneo Post Online), Kuching - Malaysia’s palm oil and palm-oil based products export rose by 55.2 per cent between January and June this year to RM67.48 billion, said Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin.
This is compared to the RM43.47 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2021.
She said in a statement that palm oil alone has contributed to 66.1 per cent of the total export earnings, which amount to RM44.63 billion this year compared to RM28.8 billion in the same period last year.
“In terms of volume, the export of palm oil and palm oil-based products between January to June rose by 2.8 per cent to 11.47 million metric tonnes (MT) from 11.15 million MT a year ago.
“Malaysia recorded strong exports despite the drop in crude palm oil (CPO) production in the first half of 2022. Based on statistics by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, CPO production fell by 1.1 per cent to 8.27 MT during the period compared to 8.36 MT during 1H21,” she said in a statement.
She explained the fall in CPO production is attributed to the dip in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield by 3.6 percent to 6.9 tonnes per hectare during the January – June 2022 period compared with 7.16 tonnes per hectare in the same period last year.
She said that on the other hand, the sharp rise in export earnings is partly due to the spike in CPO prices, both domestically and abroad.
Between January and June 2022, CPO prices rose by 55.9 percent to RM6,330 per MT from RM4,061.50 per MT during the same period in 2021.
She said the encouraging results enabled both smallholders and listed-plantation companies to generate higher revenue from the spike in CPO prices which would contribute to various sources of taxation.
In return, the government can carry out relevant socioeconomic programmes that are important for the country’s economic revival from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Despite the current softening of CPO prices, she said the potential of Malaysia’s palm oil remains intact.
“It is also gratifying to note that Malaysia’s golden crop has gained wide global acceptance, as demonstrated by the encouraging export during first half of this year.
“In this respect, I wish to thank my colleagues at the ministry and those spread across related agencies for their aggressive efforts in promoting Malaysian palm oil, particularly during my various trade missions abroad,” Zuraida added.
Zuraida stressed that the ministry remains optimistic for the prospects of Malaysian palm oil in second half of this year, partly due to the greater acceptance of the commodity globally even from non-traditional markets.
She attributed this to the success of the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities (MPIC)’s campaign “The Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil”, which is intended to counter misinformation and false information on the country’s No 1 commodity.

Palm oil trader David Ng said market investors also remained cautious ahead of supply and demand data by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), which is due on Wednesday.
“We locate the support level at RM3,500 a tonne, and resistance at RM4,200 a tonne,” he told Bernama.
Meanwhile, Mumbai-based Sunvin Group commodity research head Anilkumar Bagani said CPO futures ended higher, following the bullish rally in the overnight CBOT soybean oil market during Asian trading hours.
“The rally in soy oil futures on CBOT, as well as at the South American cash markets on Friday have allowed palm oil to manoeuvre higher, while keeping its attractive discount over soybean oil intact,” he said.
At the close, the CPO futures contract for spot month August 2022 gained RM115 to RM4,135 a tonne, September 2022 appreciated RM165 to RM4,088 a tonne, October 2022 inched up RM193 to RM4,071 a tonne, and November 2022 rose RM190 to RM4,069 a tonne.

08/08/2022,"08/08/2022 (New Straits Times), Kuala Lumpur - Kulim (Malaysia) Bhd (KULIM), through its plantation subsidiary, Mahamurni Plantations Sdn Bhd (MPSB), will build its palm-fibre oil extraction (PFOE) plant in Sedenak palm oil mill in Johor.
As part of its waste to treasure initiative, the PFOE plant extracts oil from mesocarp fibre from the processed fresh fruit bunches to produce red palm oil that can be sold at 85 per cent of the crude palm oil price.
It would generate a new income stream for the Group with an estimated RM8 million annually.
MPSB today signed a contract agreement with Eonmetall Technology Sdn Bhd (ETSB), a subsidiary of Eonmetall Group Bhd based in Penang, to build the plant, which is to be ready in the third quarter of next year.
The agreement was signed by KULIM managing director Mohd Faris Adli Shukery and ETSB managing director Yeoh Cheng Chye.
Also present were KULIM chief operating officer Fairuz Ismail and Eonmetall Group independent non-executive director Datuk Mohammad Radhi Abdul Razak.
""The project is part of our efforts to implement a circular economy through harnessing waste oil as feedstock for biofuels and utilising renewable energy for plant operations from sustainable sources.
""More importantly, it is a testament to our commitment towards the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) agenda,"" said Mohd Faris.
ETSB, which owns the patented technology, has installed more than 20 plants in the palm oil industry since 2007.
""This is a significant direction for KULIM to invest in an integrated-valued-additional approach to produce high-value palm fibre oil. The plant is designed with continuous and fully automated operation with minimal people operating, in line with the adoption of IR 4.0 in their oil palm-related processing,"" said Yeoh.

08/08/2022,"08/08/2022 (Hellenic Shipping News) - Malaysian palm oil futures jumped 4.9% on Monday, erasing some sharp losses recorded last week, as markets tracked gains in rival Dalian and Chicago oils.
The benchmark palm oil contract FCPOc3 for October delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange gained 190 ringgit to 4,068 ringgit ($912.31) a tonne by the midday break, rising for a second straight session. Palm fell 9.6% last week after two straight weekly gains.
The contract is mirroring a strong rally in soybean oil, with more short covering emerging as the price spread between soybean oil and palm oil widens, a Kuala Lumpur-based trader said.
Market is also cautious ahead of Indonesia’s export tax announcement and supply and demand data by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), the trader said.
MPOB data is due on Wednesday and it could provide clues amid concerns over a prolonged labour shortage hitting output in the world’s second-largest producer and increasing exports from neighbouring Indonesia.
Dalian’s most-active soyoil contract DBYcv1 rose 2.9%, while its palm oil contract DCPcv1 jumped 4.9%. Soyoil prices on the Chicago Board of Trade BOcv1 were up 1.4%.
Palm oil is affected by price movements in related oils as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.
Palm oil is expected to retest a support at 3,717 ringgit per tonne, a break below which could open the way towards 3,489-3,598 ringgit range, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. TECH/C

While expressing thanks and gratitude to the traders, Annuar said a survey conducted at over 200 business premises as of noon today found that the cooking oil was sold at the stipulated price on the first day of implementation of the maximum retail price.
“This is an encouraging development. We found that the cooking oil in 5kg bottles are sold at a price as low as RM28.90 each compared to the maximum price of RM34.70,” he told a press conference after chairing the meeting of the task force at the Parliament building here today.
Annuar, who is also Communications and Multimedia Minister, said the survey also found that cooking oil in 1kg bottles were sold at between RM6.70 and RM7.70 each, in 2kg bottles at between RM12.70 and RM14.70 each, while in 3kg bottles at between RM21.30 and RM21.70 each.
Last week, the government announced that the maximum price for palm cooking oil in bottles was to be set on a monthly basis based on the price of one tonne of crude palm oil (CPO) announced by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.
Hence, this month, the palm cooking oil in 5kg bottles are to be sold at RM34.70 each starting today.
Meanwhile, Annuar said the government will implement the ‘complaint window’ initiative to give the opportunity to the urban poor affected by inflation to channel their information so as not to be left behind in receiving government assistance.
For a start, he said the initiative would be implemented in Federal Territories (FT) and the details of the initiative will be announced by the FT Ministry.
“The urban poor is the group most affected by the rising cost of living and price hikes. Upon discussion with FT Minister Datuk Seri Dr Shahidan Kassim, we have agreed to begin the exercise in the FT.
“Those who are eligible but have not received any assistance for whatever reasons can lodge their complaints (through the complaint window). It is also for anyone with information on any eligible person who was not listed in the existing aid system to channel the information,” he said.

The minister said a certification for the rubber gloves industry similar to the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Certification Scheme would show that the country is taking the forced labour allegations seriously.
“They (Margma) should be developing a new certification like MSPO, a certification to show that Malaysia, especially the agro commodities (industry), is very serious about putting right [the forced labour allegations] because that is our (nation’s) income,” she said.
“The palm oil [industry] is number one, the rubber [industry] is number two, there is no way we [will] fool around with this issue [that caused us] to be sanctioned, especially by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the United States and also the European Union.”
Zuraida was speaking during the launch of the Malaysian Rubber Council (MRC)’s new guide entitled “Addressing, Preventing and Eliminating Forced Labour in the Rubber Industry in Malaysia” on Monday (Aug 8) at Hilton Kuala Lumpur.
Paperwork on track
Margma later told The Edge on the sidelines that the paperwork for the certification is “on track” and can be expected to be introduced in a year’s time.
“We will have to work on getting the certification for rubber gloves to be recognised by all our customers worldwide. We are working with the International Labour Organization (ILO) as they are our partner,” said Margma president Dr Supramaniam Shanmugam.
In her speech, Zuraida said she has informed CBP and the EU that their verification process towards Malaysia was “not fair”.
“All the actions taken by CBP or EU [are] based on one complaint or one person, that is good enough for them to take action, which I don’t think is fair. We have thousands of plantations and hundreds of rubber gloves factories, so if based on one complaint, that is not fair,” she said.
“I hope they will be more informed about the way we Malaysians work. [While] we are very progressive, of course our oil palm plantations differ from their soybean oil plantations.
“For instance, our oil palm or rubber plantations, the smallholders stay in the plantation, the children stay with the family. So where would the playground of these children be? Their playground is the plantation itself. So if you see them picking one of the rubber seeds or palm oil seeds, it is interpreted as, and they charged us with, child labour, [which] is not fair.”
On that note, she added that the ministry is already looking into setting up education centres for the local and migrant workers in both rubber and oil palm plantations.
“The big industry players will assist in setting up these education centres for the workers,” she told the media after the launch.
Over the past two years, eight Malaysian companies from the plantation and glove sectors have been subject to Withhold Release Orders (WRO) by the CBP.
The companies in the glove sectors still under sanction by the CBP are YTY Group, Smart Glove, Brightway Group and Supermax Corporation Bhd units Maxter Glove Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, Maxwell Glove Manufacturing Bhd and Supermax Glove Manufacturing.

08/08/2022,"08/08/2022 (The Sun Daily), Kota Bharu - Two local men aged 39 and 41 have been detained for the suspected misappropriation of about 30,000 litres of diesel using a palm oil tanker in Kuala Krai at 7 pm, yesterday.
Kelantan Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) enforcement head, Aswadi Jaafar said the leakage of the controlled item was foiled in an integrated operation with Tok Bali Region Three Marine Police and the Kuala Krai district police headquarters as both suspects failed to produce any documents for owning the diesel which is a controlled item.
“The seized controlled diesel is valued at RM64,500, while a Mercedes Benz lorry worth RM40,000 was also confiscated.
“The suspects were remanded for four days and further investigations would be conducted under Control of Supplies Act 1961,” he said in a statement today.
Elaborating further, Aswadi said the modus operandi of the syndicate is to use a palm oil tanker which has been modified to evade the attention of the authorities in diverting the diesel.
“The arrest was made based on intelligence aquired by the KPDNHEP operation team with police by detecting the suspicious movements of palm oil tankers in Jalan Kota Bharu-Gua Musang and they moved in to flag down the lorry in Kuala Krai.
“Inspection also found the palm oil tanker was carrying a load of diesel believed to be diverted to other users,” he said.
He said an initial investigation found the diesel was obtained with purchases from petrol stations around Kelantan and Terengganu while a check on the lorry found it had been modified in the back portion of the tanker. - Bernama

06.08.2022,"06.08.2022 (www.thestar.com.my) - KUALA LUMPUR: The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives is likely to trend lower next week on profit-taking activities.
Interband Group of Companies senior palm oil trader Jim Teh said stocks are expected to remain high in Malaysia due to Indonesia’s lower Indonesian export prices.
""As such, the price movement next week is expected to confine between RM3,100 and RM3,300 per tonne,” he told Bernama.
Indonesia is trying to clear their high inventories by waiving its export levy, effective July 15 to Aug 31, 2022.
Meanwhile, palm oil trader David Ng expects futures prices to trade with a downside bias given the expectation of higher production and stock level ahead of the key crop report due to be released next week.
For the trading week just ended, Malaysian CPO futures were mostly lower, weighed by strong competition from lower Indonesian export prices and higher inventory concerns in the coming weeks.
According to CGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd, Malaysia’s CPO output is expected to grow by 2.8 per cent month-on-month (m-o-m) and 4.3 per cent year-on-year to 1.59 million tonnes in July 2022.
It also said Malaysia’s palm oil stocks are estimated to rise by 9.8 per cent m-o-m to 1.82 million tonnes as at the end of July 2022, mainly due to higher output.
On a Friday-to-Friday basis, spot month August 2022 shed RM10 to RM4,020 a tonne, September 2022 was RM36 lower at RM3,923 a tonne and October 2022 was down RM79 to RM3,878 a tonne.
November 2022 slid RM100 to RM3,879 a tonne, December 2022 decreased RM66 to RM3,913 a tonne and January 2023 declined RM123 to RM3,966 per tonne.
Total volume expanded to 336,919 lots from 295,872 lots in the previous week, while open interest narrowed to 195,371 contracts from 215,234 contracts previously.
The physical CPO price for August South rose by RM50 to RM4,050 a tonne. - Bernama

Palm oil trader David Ng said, however, that prices may face further downsides in view of high stockpile levels in the country, which may weigh pressure on CPO prices.
“Hence, we locate the support level at RM3,500 and resistance at RM4,200 a tonne,” he told Bernama.
At the close, the CPO futures contract for spot month August 2022 gained RM80 to RM4,020 a tonne, September 2022 appreciated RM69 to RM3,923 a tonne, October 2022 inched up RM57 to RM3,878 a tonne, and November 2022 rose RM53 to RM3,879 a tonne.
Meanwhile, December 2022 was RM53 higher at RM3,913 a tonne and January 2023 climbed by RM48 to RM3,966 a tonne.
Total volume shrank to 54,468 lots from 86,615 lots on Thursday, while open interest shed to 195,371 from 282,128 contracts previously.

08.08.2022,"08.08.2022 (www.hellenicshippingnews.com) - The operating rate at soybean crushing plants in China slumped to a year-to-date low of 53.5% at the start of August amid prolonged negative crush margins and replacement margins, prompting crushers to reduce soybean purchases and cut operating rates at plants, leading to a fall in soybean prices, market sources said Aug. 5
Over January-May, crushers were able to achieve positive replacement margins of Yuan 100-500/mt by selling spot cargoes of soybean meal and oil in China’s domestic market, according to brokers.
However, the replacement margin for spot trading has fallen below the breakeven level since June, driven by rapid falls in soybean oil prices as rival palm oil prices fall amid increasing supply and weakening demand.
Crushing activity was further pressured by falling demand for soybean oil in China, which slumped 50% year on year in June.
The soybean replacement margin for crushers was calculated at a steep minus Yuan 48/mt (minus $7.10mt) Aug. 4, market sources said.
Platts assessed the Chinese gross crush margin for soybeans at minus $59.16/mt Aug. 4, down 49% month on month, S&P Global Commodity Insights data showed.
Crushing plants were currently operating at a loss of Yuan 450/mt ($67/mt), market sources said.
“The operation rate at our crushing plant is only 60% currently — the rate used to be at 90% last year — meanwhile the industry crushing operation rate would be below 60%,” one Chinese crusher source said.
The operating rate at soybean crushing plants at 53.5% was down 5% month on month and the lowest to date in 2022, market sources said.
As a result, August soybean shipments to China were now expected to total 6.2 million mt, down from an initial projection of 7 million mt, market sources said.
The industry has also revised its demand projection for September to 5.5 million mt from 6 million mt earlier, with some market participants expecting only 5 million mt. As of Aug.4, only 1.5 million mt of soybeans had been purchased by China for September.
Brighter outlook
However, the oversupply situation weighing on the soybean oil market was expected to start easing gradually in August as demand for soybean oil enters a seasonally stronger period due to festival celebrations across Asia in September and October, helping to reduce soybean oil inventories at crushing plants.
“Soybean oil will recover slightly with declining inventory, however, the price will still be under pressure because the arrival volume of palm oil will be higher in the next few weeks,” a Chinese crusher source said, adding: “The market believes that palm oil export and production will keep prices of vegetable oils bearish.”
Sales of soybean meal have been picking up, with physical spot cargo prices rising 5.3% month on month to Yuan 4,170/mt ($618/mt) Aug. 4, supporting the replacement margin in coming weeks.
“Ten to 20 cargoes of nearby shipments will be actively traded over this week as the replacement margin is expected to be better with the lower arrival volume of imported soybean at port,” a Chinese trader said.

07.08.2022,"07.08.2022 (www.thedailystar.net) - Edible oil processors in Bangladesh have proposed the government raise the price of soybean oil by Tk 20 per litre, according to processors and officials of the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission (BTTC).
The Bangladesh Vegetable Oil Refiners & Vanaspati Manufacturers Association, a forum of the refiners, submitted a proposal to this effect to the BTTC on Thursday, said Md Mahmodul Hasan, deputy chief of the commission, today. 
The association has called for raising the non-branded soybean oil to Tk 180 per litre, a litre branded soybean oil to Tk 205, and the five-litre container to Tk 960, according to the proposal.
The refiners are seeking an upward revision of the price of edible oil as the US dollar has strengthened against the taka that has raised the cost of imports, said a senior official of an edible oil processor.   
""We have to buy a dollar by Tk 111-112,"" he told The Daily Star.
The American greenback has gained by as much as 20 per cent against the local currency amid US dollar shortages caused by abnormally high imports against lower-than-expected export receipts and a slowdown in remittance. This has driven down the foreign currency reserves to below $40 billion recently.
On June 9, the government increased the price of soybean oil by Tk 5 to Tk 7 per litre, which came a week after Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said the prices of the key kitchen item would come down soon since their prices had dropped in the international markets.
On June 26, edible oil refiners cut soybean oil prices up to Tk 6 a litre though the consumers' rights organisation said the rates should have been reduced by at least Tk 30 amid falling prices of the item in the global market.
Citing data from Reuters, the BTTC earlier said the price of crude soybean oil fell 26 per cent in Argentina in a month. It fell to $1,464 a tonne on June 22 from $1,970 a month ago. Palm oil price also fell by 27 per cent to $1,230 from $1,690.
Edible oil prices in Bangladesh depend on international price movements since up to 90 per cent of the country's annual demand of 20 lakh tonnes is met through imports.

07.08.2022,"07.08.2022 (www.freemalaysiatoday.com) - SERDANG: Cooking oil producers and sellers have been told to avoid hoarding or rationing the commodity once a controlled maximum price at RM34.70 per five-kilogramme bottle comes into effect tomorrow.
Anti-inflation task force chairman Annuar Musa said traders and retailers who resorted to such practices would ultimately lose out, apart from creating problems for consumers.
“Just because the price of oil will drop, for example, people should not start hoarding. It won’t solve the problem,” he said when asked about the possibility of hoarding when the price of cooking oil is low.
Annuar said it was apparent that cooperation among agencies had produced a positive impact as some supermarkets had begun reducing the price of unsubsidised bottled cooking oil although the ceiling price would only come into effect tomorrow
“So far I am very satisfied because after the announcement on the maximum price for cooking oil, many have reduced the price to below RM34.70 even before Aug 8.
“Yesterday, in Melaka I saw chicken being sold at RM7.99 per kg although the ceiling price is RM9.40. That means we can do it (reduce prices) but we need the cooperation of all parties,” he added.
The government has set the ceiling price of unsubsidised pure palm-based cooking oil at RM34.70 per five-kilogramme bottle effective Aug 8.The price of cooking oil will be set each month and announced by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.

07.08.2022,"07.08.2022 (www.newsdayexpress.com) - New Delhi, Aug 7 (Language) Due to the fall in the prices of edible oils in the foreign markets last week, almost all including mustard, groundnut, soybean oil-oilseeds and cottonseed, crude palm oil (CPO), palmolein oil in the oil-oilseeds markets across the country. Edible oilseeds prices recorded a loss. Rest of the oil and oilseeds prices remained unchanged.
Traders said oilseeds prices fell last week due to cheaper imported edible oils.
Sources said that the CPO price has weakened at the present time. The importers’ oil is lying at the ports and they are forced to sell them cheaply after the sudden drop in prices. Apart from this, the next consignment of CPO, Sunflower and Palmolein oil will come, its price will also be Rs 20-30 less than the current price.
Sources said that in view of the sharp fall in global oil and oilseeds prices, the government had called a meeting of oil unions and oil industry last week. In the meeting, representatives of oil associations and oil industry have assured to reduce edible oil prices by Rs 8-10 per liter in the next 10 days. The prices of edible oil and oilseeds are under heavy pressure abroad as well as in the country, which is the main reason for the fall in prices.
He said that despite assurances by the oil traders and representatives of oil organizations to reduce the prices of edible oilseeds by about Rs 10 a liter, the consumers are not getting proper benefit of the fall in global oil prices as the maximum retail price (MRP) is not being passed on to the consumers. In comparison, about 40-50 rupees are more by the liter. Even if there is a decrease of 10 rupees in this 50 rupees, then the consumers will not be able to get the proper benefit.
Giving an example, the source said, “The Argentine sunflower oil price at Kandla port is $1,550 per tonne or Rs 123.50 per kg. After adding port cost and refining cost, the total cost will come to Rs 130 per kg. Now adding the cost of GST, packing and transportation on this, then the total cost is Rs 134 per liter. Now if the margin of retail oil traders and refining people are also put, then the price of this sunflower oil should be maximum Rs 145-150 a liter.
He said that in the last two-and-a-half months, the prices of sunflower, soybean degum, palmolein and CPO have come down by Rs 75-85 a liter, but the consumers are yet to get its due benefit.
However, sources said that this sunflower oil is being available to the general consumers in the retail market at a price of Rs 190-200 per liter. Even after the reduction in the price, its price is only between Rs 180-190 per liter.
Sources said there is a need to control the MRP in the oil business so that its MRP exceeds the actual cost to a limit. Despite the sharp fall in the global edible oil prices and the meetings of the oil traders, neither the consumers, nor the farmers nor the oil industry are seeing the benefits of the fall in edible oil prices.
Sources said that the wholesale price including surcharge of mustard oil is Rs 135 per liter and in retail trade its maximum price should be Rs 155-160 per liter. But in the retail market, mustard oil is selling around Rs 175 per liter.
He said that the new consignment of import of crude palm oil (CPO), palmolein will be cheaper by about Rs 20 per liter from the current weak price. The price of new consignments of sunflower oil is also expected to be Rs 25-30 cheaper than the current price.
Sources said that it is cheaper to import edible oil from abroad, which is the main reason for the decline in edible oilseeds. Sunflower oil, which used to cost $2,400 a tonne sometime back, is currently available at $1,550 a tonne. Similarly, soybean degum and palmolein have become cheaper than before but it is too late to get its proper benefits.
Farmers need to be encouraged to make the country self-reliant in oilseeds production. By giving remunerative price to the farmers for their produce, they will be motivated to increase the production.
Sources said that the price of mustard seeds closed at Rs 7,215-7,265 per quintal with a loss of Rs 75 last week as compared to last weekend. Mustard Dadri oil declined by Rs 200 to Rs 14,600 per quintal during the weekend under review. On the other hand, mustard, pakki ghani and kutchi ghani oil also fell by Rs. 30 each to Rs. 2,310-2,390 and Rs. 2,340-2,455 per tin (15 kg) respectively.
Sources said wholesale prices of soyabean grains and loose fell by Rs 90 each to Rs 6,360-6,435 and Rs 6,135-6,210 per quintal, respectively, for the week under review amid a general trend of declining trend.
Soybean oil prices also saw a decline in the week under review. The wholesale price of Soyabean Delhi declined by Rs 350 to Rs 13,250, Soyabean Indore declined by Rs 150 to Rs 13,150 and Soyabean Degum declined by Rs 300 to Rs 11,950 per quintal.
Groundnut oil and oilseeds also declined due to costlier demand affected. Groundnut oilseeds fell by Rs 25 to close at Rs 6,870-6,995 per quintal during the weekend under review. Groundnut oil, Gujarat, declined by Rs 120 to Rs 16,000 per quintal against the previous weekend’s closing price, while Groundnut Solvent Refined fell by Rs 20 to Rs 2,670-2,860 per tin.
Crude palm oil (CPO) prices declined by Rs 150 to Rs 11,150 a quintal in the week under review. While the price of Palmolein Delhi declined by Rs 100 to Rs 13,200 and that of Palmolein Kandla declined by Rs 100 to Rs 12,100 per quintal.
Cottonseed oil price also closed at Rs 14,000 per quintal with a loss of Rs 350 in almost closed trade.

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Star Online), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia's palm oil inventories at end-July likely jumped to the highest in eight months due to improving production and soaring imports, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
Stockpiles in the world's second-largest producer expanded 8.3% from June to 1.79 million tonnes, according to the median estimate of 11 traders and analysts polled by Reuters.
Production also rose to its highest since November, up 2% to 1.58 million tonnes. Exports gained 2.2% to 1.22 million tonnes while imports surged 35% to 80,000 tonnes.
The better exports could be due to slower than expected palm oil exports from larger producer Indonesia, despite Jakarta easing restrictions on shipments, Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CGS-CIMB Research, said in a note.
Sathia Varqa, co-founder of Singapore-based Palm Oil Analytics, said exports would soon gather pace in Indonesia.
""Lower cash prices, widening palm discount to its nearest rival bean oil and reduced export tax will offer increasing palm export opportunities to Indonesia, fuelling competition to Malaysia,"" Varqa said.
Concerns over demand for Malaysian palm oil as Indonesia cuts taxes and raises exportable volumes to clear its lofty inventories has pushed benchmark crude palm oil prices from record highs to its lowest in a year.
Specially curated for corporate leaders
Varqa expects palm oil prices to flux between 3,800-4,200 ringgit ($943.40) a tonne in August and September.
The Malaysian Palm Oil Board is scheduled to release its data on August 10.

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - The Special Task Force on Jihad Against Inflation on Thursday has requested the Malaysian Palm Oil Board to conduct two further studies including one on a two-tier pricing system for palm cooking oil.
“The first is to study the feasibility or appropriateness of whether to maintain the current system, which is the price of domestic cooking oil and also exports on a one-price system.
“[This is to] compare with a two-tier pricing system, which is one price for exported cooking oil and one price structure for cooking oil for domestic use,” said the Jihad committee’s chairman Tan Sri Annuar Musa at a press conference in Parliment.
According to Annuar, the committee has been informed that only about 5.6% of the palm cooking oil produced by the country is used for domestic use, of which about 60,000 tonnes per month are actually subsidized by the Government under the subsidy programme for packet cooking oil.
The committee is giving MPOB the time needed to undertake the studies, added Annuar.
On Monday (Aug 1), the Ketereh MP said the Government has decided the pricing mechanism for 5kg bottles of palm cooking oil will be determined every month, with the price for August set at RM34.70 per bottle.
The sale price will come into effect on Aug 8, and that the price of palm cooking oil will be set monthly based on the previous month's CPO price which will be announced by MPOB on the 1st of the following month.
Regarding how the price mechanism works, Annuar had noted that a calculation method will be determined by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs after MPOB declares the monthly CPO price.
Since July 1, Putrajaya has ceased subsidies for palm cooking oil of 2kg, 3kg and 5kg bottles. However, the government has continued to subsidise 1kg cooking oil packs, which are packaged in polybags and priced at RM2.50 each.

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Sun Daily), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia’s crude palm oil (CPO) output is expected to grow by 2.8% month-on-month (m-o-m) and 4.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 1.59 million tonnes in July 2022, said CGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd.
“The m-o-m increase in CPO output was driven by seasonal factors,” it said in a research note on Aug 4.
As such, Malaysia’s palm oil stocks are estimated to rose by 9.8% m-o-m to 1.82 million tonnes as at end-July 2022, mainly due to higher output.
The research firm also estimates Malaysia’s palm oil inventory probably grew by 9.8% m-o-m and 21.4% y-o-y to 1.82 million tonnes as at end-July 2022, its highest level since June 2020, due to higher output.
“Our estimate of 1.82 million tonnes for July’s palm oil stock level is 4.0% below the 10-year historical July average of 1.89 million tonnes,” it said.
Meanwhile, palm oil exports are likely to be higher by 3.6% m-o-m but fell 12.2% y-o-y to 1.24 million tonnes, based on export statistics by cargo surveyors Intertek (+0.8% m-o-m), SGS (+6%) and Amspec Malaysia (+4% m-o-m).
“The higher m-o-m palm oil exports from Malaysia could be due to slower-than-expected palm oil exports from Indonesia in July as exporters anticipated potential cuts in export tax for Indonesian palm oil from Aug 1,“ it said.
It was reported that Indonesia has lowered its CPO reference price to US$872 (RM3,880) per tonne, effective Aug 1-15, 2022, which would place CPO export duty for the first two weeks of August at US$33 per tonne, while the export levy is waived until Aug 31, 2022.
It said the significantly lower export tax from Aug 1-15 of US$33 per tonne against US$288 per tonne from July 15-30 is likely to boost Indonesia’s export shipments in August compared to July as exporters take advantage of the significant savings in CPO export taxes and levy.
Indonesia has also raised the domestic market obligation and exports ratio to 1:9 versus 1:7 from Aug 1.
“These two factors will likely lead to weaker palm oil exports from Malaysia in August,” it said.
CGS-CIMB expects CPO price to trade in the range of RM4,000 to RM4,500 per tonne as labour shortages, geopolitical risks and weather uncertainties will likely be supportive of CPO prices. - Bernama

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Sun Daily), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia is prepared to meet India’s demand for palm oil in light of potentially inconsistent supply from Indonesia as a result of changes in palm oil export policy, which have created market uncertainty for major importing countries.
Plantation Industries and Commodities (MPIC) Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said that in less than one year, Indonesia’s policy on palm oil export has created market uncertainties in major importing countries like India.
“The MPIC will step up efforts to promote Malaysian palm oil, not just in India but throughout the world, including non-traditional markets in line with ‘The Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil’ campaign,” she said in a statement on Aug 4.
Quoting the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers’ Association (IVPA) president Sudhakar Desai, Zuraida said Malaysia has kept its policy pertaining to palm oil trading in a stable manner, thus able to meet India’s demand during the period of Indonesia’s ban on palm oil export.
“Sudhakar was also quoted as saying that Malaysia’s good supply chain played a crucial role in the edible oil security for India’s demand in the last two months,” she added.
India’s faith in Malaysia as the world’s second-largest palm oil producer and as a trusted supplier has been further fortified by a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between IVPA and the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) at the Malaysia International Agricommodity Expo & Summit 2022 recently.
The MoU aims to strengthen cooperation between India and Malaysia in the palm oil industry, enhance collaboration to promote the Indian palm oil industry, exchange information pertaining to sustainability efforts as well as in palm oil research and development.
“Towards this end, I share the sentiment by IVPA president Sudhakar who is confident that both the association and MPOC are able to take up dynamic policy-related issues with respective policymakers for the benefit of the industry in both countries,” she emphasised.
IVPA has estimated India’s palm oil imports from Malaysia to remain stable in the second half of 2022, making up about 55% of India’s total palm oil imports despite Indonesia’s move to accelerate palm oil exports in recent times.
It was reported that IVPA further foresees a surge in demand to the 800,000 tonnes per month region for the next six months or an improvement of about 20% from the first half of this year. - Bernama

“The MPIC will step up efforts to promote Malaysian palm oil, not just in India but throughout the world, including non-traditional markets in line with ‘The Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil’ campaign,” she said in a statement on Aug 4.
Quoting the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers’ Association (IVPA) president Sudhakar Desai, Zuraida said Malaysia has kept its policy pertaining to palm oil trading in a stable manner, thus able to meet India’s demand during the period of Indonesia’s ban on palm oil export.
“Sudhakar was also quoted as saying that Malaysia’s good supply chain played a crucial role in the edible oil security for India’s demand in the last two months,” she added.
India’s faith in Malaysia as the world’s second-largest palm oil producer and as a trusted supplier has been further fortified by a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between IVPA and the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) at the Malaysia International Agricommodity Expo & Summit 2022 recently.
The MoU aims to strengthen cooperation between India and Malaysia in the palm oil industry, enhance collaboration to promote the Indian palm oil industry, exchange information pertaining to sustainability efforts as well as in palm oil research and development.
“Towards this end, I share the sentiment by IVPA president Sudhakar who is confident that both the association and MPOC are able to take up dynamic policy-related issues with respective policymakers for the benefit of the industry in both countries,” she emphasised.
IVPA has estimated India’s palm oil imports from Malaysia to remain stable in the second half of 2022, making up about 55% of India’s total palm oil imports despite Indonesia’s move to accelerate palm oil exports in recent times.
It was reported that IVPA further foresees a surge in demand to the 800,000 tonnes per month region for the next six months or an improvement of about 20% from the first half of this year. - Bernama

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Star Online), Petaling Jaya - It will take some three to five years before plantation stakeholders who invested in automation could see the potential outcome, says Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) chairman Larry Sng.
Sng said that if the efforts invested pull through, the industry will no longer be heavily dependent on foreign labour.
""Mechanisation is high on the agenda and some major companies have already invested in them but it takes a little more time before you see the fruition.
""Research has been put into automation, and it will take a few years for us to know the results,” he told The Star yesterday.
Sng, who is Julau MP was responding to the on-going issue of labour shortages in the plantation sector.
Sng also said the use of drones and vibration for harvesting fruits are a few examples companies are looking at, adding that there is more technology to explore.
On Wednesday, Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said India and Pakistan have offered to send their citizens to work in Malaysian plantations.
As there are issues in procuring labour from Bangladesh and Indonesia, workers from India and Pakistan may be the short-term solution for the plantation industry, Zuraida told the Parliament.
Incorporated Society of Planters chief executive I. Rajindran said in view of labour shortages, automation and digitalisation are a way forward for the plantation industry to sustain in the business.
Although there is no one best solution, he said automation will be able to provide a different means for the industry to operate instead of losing millions.
He added that incorporating digitalisation and smart farming could also attract young locals to work in the industry and help them develop new skills.
Human Resources Malaysia (Pusma) president Zarina Ismail also agreed that the only foreseeable solution is switching to the use of technology.
She said the implications of labour have caused Malaysia to be in Tier Three of the US State Department’s annual human trafficking report.

03/08/2022,"03/08/2022 (Reuters), Mumbai - India's soyoil imports in July more than doubled from a month ago to a record high as refiners ramped up purchases to take advantage of New Delhi's move to allow duty free imports of the vegetable oil to calm all-time high prices, five dealers said.
Higher soyoil purchases by the world's biggest edible oil importer will support U.S. soyoil prices , but will dent rival palm oil's share in Indian buying and force Malaysian and Indonesian sellers to offer discounts to regain the market share, trading sources said.
The country's soyoil imports in July jumped 113% from a month ago to a record 493,000 tonnes, according to the average estimate from five dealers with global trading firms that account for more than 80% of India's soyoil imports.
""Refiners rushed to buy soyoil after government allocated tariff-rate quota for the imports,"" B.V. Mehta, executive director of Solvent Extractors' Association of India, said.
India in late May allowed duty-free imports of 2 million tonnes each of soyoil and sunflower oil for the current and next fiscal years ending March 31, as part of efforts to keep a lid on local edible oil prices.
Through the end of June, soy oil's premium over palm oil was less than $150 per tonne, but since palm oil attracts a 5.5% import tax, palm oil was effectively more expensive for Indian buyers, Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of Sunvin Group, a leading vegetable oil broker, said.
""Then palm oil supply was also limited because of Indonesia's export restrictions. Buying soyoil was then easy and profitable as well,"" he added.
The Solvent Extractors' Association of India, a Mumbai-based trade body, is likely to publish its import estimate for July in mid-August.
India has also allowed imports of 2 million tonnes of sunflower oil without import taxes, but availability of sun oil has been limited due to shipment disruptions from top exporter Ukraine, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.
Soyoil imports look set to remain robust in the coming months and India could import a record 4.5 million tonnes of soyoil in 2021/23 marketing year ending on October 31, compared to 2.87 million tonnes a year ago, dealers said.
Soyoil usually accounts for a fifth of India's total vegetable oil imports, but this year its share could rise to one third, dealers said.
India traditionally buys soyoil from Argentina and Brazil, but in the past few months has also made purchases from the United States, Russia and Turkey, said a New-Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Star Online), Jakarta - Indonesia’s economy likely accelerated last quarter, buoyed by strong exports and private consumption, but a slowdown in China and the threat of a global recession pose significant risks in coming months, a Reuters poll has found.
With rising global commodity prices, the resource-rich country has been enjoying an export boom.
Its trade surplus in 2022’s first half was the highest on record at US$24.89bil (RM110.9bil), more than double that of the same period in 2021.
South-East Asia’s largest economy grew 5.17% in the April-June period compared with the same three months a year earlier, the median forecast of 22 economists polled July 25-Aug 2 showed.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy was predicted to have risen 3.44% last quarter from the previous three-month period, which saw a contraction of 0.96%, according to a smaller sample of 10 economists.
“Daily new (coronavirus) cases remained under control and domestic activity continued to improve in the June 22 quarter.
“The quarter also had Ramadan and we expect robust sequential momentum for private consumption,” wrote Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC.
Specially curated for corporate leaders
“Windfall tax revenue from high commodity prices continued to support government spending.
“However, almost a month-long palm oil export ban in May will likely cause exports growth to contract sequentially.”
A separate Reuters poll found gross domestic product or GDP growth would be 5.1% this year, within Bank Indonesia’s (BI) estimate of 4.5% to 5.3%, and moderate only slightly to 5.0% in 2023.
Inflation has been of little concern to Indonesia’s central bank so far, despite rising to a seven-year high in July.
BI governor Perry Warjiyo said core inflation was below the bank’s 2.99% forecast and that policy would be determined by the core inflation rate and economic growth.
“We believe that BI will hike its key benchmark rate this quarter as core inflation has been increasing persistently since October 2021,” noted Irman Faiz of Bank Danamon.
“The rate hike will help slow down the coming inflation pressure and help stabilise the rupiah without harming recovery.” — Reuters

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (Channel News Asia), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia said on Thursday it was ready to help India meet its palm oil demand in view of potentially erratic supply from top supplier Indonesia.
India is expected to see a surge in demand to around 800,000 tonnes per month for the next six months, Malaysia's Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin said in a statement, citing data from the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association.

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Star Online) - KUALA LUMPUR: How plantation companies perform financially in the second quarter of this year (2Q22) will depend on their exposure to the upstream business in Malaysia and Indonesia, says Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB).
HLIB expects planters with significant upstream exposure in Malaysia to post flat to higher sequential performance in 2Q22 on the back of higher fresh fruit bunch (FFB) output and palm product prices.
It added that planters with significant exposure to Indonesian estates are anticipated to post a weaker performance in 2Q22 due to the export restrictions imposed by Indonesia which would weigh down on sales volumes.
Another key driver that would boost year-on-year upstream earnings of planters in the period is the higher crude palm oil (CPO) price, which will more than mitigate the higher production cost and lower FFB output.
By companies, HLIB forecasts FGV Holdings Bhd’s core earnings to be higher in 2Q22 on the back of higher FFB output and higher palm product prices.
Although Hap Seng Plantations Holdings Bhd reported a quarter-on-quarter decline in FFB output, the research firm expects the group to post a flat or marginally higher earnings in 2Q22, as the lower FFB output would be mitigated by higher palm product prices.
IOI Corp Bhd’s core earnings are expected to improve in 2Q22, driven by better performance from its upstream segment arising from marginally higher FFB output and palm product prices, opined HLIB.
“There is expected to be better performance in the downstream segment arising from a recovery in palm refining and fractionation margins, as well as healthy margins at the oleochemical sub-segment,” it said.
That said, HLIB is keeping an “overweight” stance on the plantation sector supported by an anticipated recovery in the CPO price and commendable valuations.
“For exposure, we prefer integrated players such as Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd and IOI over purer upstream players, as earnings of integrated players tend to be better insulated amidst the volatile palm product price trend,” it said.
Bursa Malaysia-listed planters will start reporting their quarterly results starting from Aug 17.
HLIB added that the recent severe CPO price decline was overdone, as supply prospects of major vegetable oil remained uncertain and demand prospects have turned more favourable due to palm oil’s improved price competitiveness, low inventory levels among major importing countries as well as the favourable palm oil-gas oil spread.
It is noteworthy that the CPO price has recovered from its low of RM3,677 per tonne in mid-July to RM4,127 per tonne, bringing its year-to-date average price to RM5,966 per tonne. “Hence, we maintain our 2022 to 2024 CPO price assumptions of RM5,500, RM4,500, RM3,800 per tonne, respectively,” it said.

04/08/2022,"04/08/2022 (The Star Online) - PULLARAO Daravathu and thousands of fellow farmers from Telangana in India’s south are busy planting oil palms as their home state aims to add more area under the crop within four years than the entire country has in decades.
Telangana is targeting two million additional acres under oil palm cultivation in the next four years, and is going to great lengths to achieve this goal – from building large dams and irrigation canals to importing millions of germinated sprouts.
Generous government subsidies and bumper profit potential compared to other crops are also encouraging farmers like Daravathu to shift to oil palms.
“Oil palm is giving more than 200,000 Indian rupees (US$2,536 or RM11,302.95) per acre return to farmers who planted the crop some years back.
“In rice, I am struggling to earn 40,000 rupees (RM22,64.83) even after putting in lots of effort,” said Daravathu, who was planting oil palm on his five-acre farm at Sathupally, nearly 300 km east of Hyderabad, the state capital.
The recent rally in palm oil prices has more than doubled prices of fresh fruit bunches, which farmers sell to oil mills.
For years, price volatility, water scarcity and a gestation period of nearly four years limited oil palm plantation in India to less than one million acres, mostly in coastal Andhra Pradesh, the state that Telangana was carved out of in 2014.
People-first approach and putting employees at the heart of the company
But Telangana, which occupies an inland region on the Deccan Plateau, is now keen to emerge as India’s main palm oil hub, with an area target that would place the state as the fifth largest oil palm grower globally – from a negligible base currently.
The drive could reduce India’s mammoth vegetable oil imports, which cost the country a record US$18.9bil (RM84.24bil) a year ago and widened the national trade deficit.
India fulfills two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports of around 14 million tonnes annually, including around 8.5 million tonnes of palm oil.
The federal government is keen to increase palm oil output to slash those expensive imports, which lifted inflation this year to multi-year highs after top supplier Indonesia abruptly halted exports.
“In the next four years, most of the palm planting would be done, and after seven to eight years Telangana could be producing four million tonnes of palm oil,” L. Venkatram Reddy, director of horticulture at the state government told Reuters.
India currently produces less than 300,000 tonnes of palm oil and relies on imports from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand to fulfill its requirements.
Even if Telangana manages to grow oil palm on only one million acres and produces two million tonnes of palm oil, it would be a huge achievement, said Chava Venkateswara Rao of Godrej Agrovet Ltd, the country’s biggest palm oil producer.
Until last year, the country was adding around 35,000 acres under oil palm every year.
Some areas in Telangana have sufficient water for thirsty oil palms thanks to the rivers such as the Godavari, Krishna and Bhima. But many pockets lacked sufficient water to cater to the oil palm’s need of up to 265 litres per tree per day.
To overcome that, the state has built massive lift irrigation projects and a canal network that is now allowing farmers to plant oil palms across most of the state.
“We used to face water scarcity in summer season. Now, with the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, we have ample water for oil palm,” said farmer Bollampalli Venkateshwar Rao, who planted oil palms on 12 acres.
The Kaleshwaram irrigation project, which is nearly complete, cost the state 1.15 trillion rupees (US$14.44bil or RM64.36bil).
Authorities are giving permission to cultivate oil palms only after farmers install water-conserving micro irrigation systems, said Reddy, adding “The central and state government’s subsidies are covering almost the entire cost of drip irrigation system.”
The shift towards oil palm from paddy rice and other crops could help the state to bring down annual paddy procurement by around 2.5 million tonnes, and trim the electricity bill for lift irrigation projects by 15 billion rupees as drip-fed oil palms need less water than paddy, Reddy said.
Ravi Mathur, who heads the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research, a government-backed body spearheading the oil palm push, said the lift irrigation project has made oil palm planting feasible in areas previously unsuitable for the crop because of water scarcity.
While thousands of farmers are keen to shift to oil palm, the availability of seedlings is limited, and preparing them is a lengthy process which takes almost a year.
Companies operating in Telangana imported 12.5 million sprouts last year and made seedlings for around 200,000 acres this year, said an official with the state-run TS Oilfed, the country’s biggest importer of germinated sprouts
The state is aiming to import 15 million sprouts this year – mainly sourced from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Costa Rica – and 50 million next year to achieve the target, he said.
But only handful of companies are supplying germinated sprouts.
“There is sudden surge in demand following a rally in palm oil prices. Companies are not able to supply as much we need this year,” said Sougata Niyogi, a top official at Godrej Agrovet. “The supply situation would become more comfortable next year.” — Reuters

03/08/2022,"03/08/2022 (The Edge Markets) - The government has no legal provisions that can be enforced on oil palm plantation companies that earn large profits from palm oil exports so that they supply a certain quantity of palm oil for domestic consumption at a cheap price.
Minister of Plantation Industries and Commodities Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said plantation companies have already been subject to the extraordinary profit levy, while the imposition of new regulations may burden industry players and make it unattractive to engage in the business.
“The oil palm industry is also subject to cess collection of RM16 per tonne starting March 1, 2021 compared to the old rate of RM14 per tonne.
“This cess collection is also used to finance activities in dealing with the supply of crude palm oil in the market and stabilising its price,” she said in a written parliamentary reply to Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim dated Aug 2 (Tuesday) which was uploaded on the Parliament website.
Hassan had wanted to know whether the Government will impose legal regulations on oil palm plantation companies that make huge profits from their palm oil exports.
This is so that companies can supply sufficient quantities of palm oil at low prices for domestic consumption so that Malaysians can buy cooking oils at cheap prices and that the Government does not need to spend a lot on subsidies.
According to Zuraida, the subsidies given by the Government are part of the revenue collected through the extraordinary profit levy.
As such, she said companies have contributed part of their income through tax payments used by the Government to subsidise 1kg polybag cooking oil for domestic use.

To overcome that, the state has built massive lift irrigation projects and a canal network that is now allowing farmers to plant oil palms across most of the state.
""We used to face water scarcity in summer season. Now, with the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project, we have ample water for oil palm,"" said farmer Bollampalli Venkateshwar Rao, who planted oil palms on 12 acres.
The Kaleshwaram irrigation project, which is nearly complete, cost the state 1.15 trillion rupees ($14.44 billion).
Authorities are giving permission to cultivate oil palms only after farmers install water-conserving micro irrigation systems, said Reddy, adding ""The central and state government's subsidies are covering almost the entire cost of drip irrigation system.""
The shift towards oil palm from paddy rice and other crops could help the state to bring down annual paddy procurement by around 2.5 million tonnes, and trim the electricity bill for lift irrigation projects by 15 billion rupees as drip-fed oil palms need less water than paddy, Reddy said.
Ravi Mathur, who heads the Indian Institute of Oil Palm Research (IIOPR), a government-backed body spearheading the oil palm push, said the lift irrigation project has made oil palm planting feasible in areas previously unsuitable for the crop because of water scarcity.
PLANTING MATERIAL SCARCITY
While thousands of farmers are keen to shift to oil palm, the availability of seedlings is limited, and preparing them is a lengthy process which takes almost a year.
Companies operating in Telangana imported 12.5 million sprouts last year and made seedlings for around 200,000 acres this year, said an official with the state-run TS Oilfed, the country's biggest importer of germinated sprouts
The state is aiming to import 15 million sprouts this year - mainly sourced from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Costa Rica - and 50 million next year to achieve the target, he said.
But only handful of companies are supplying germinated sprouts.
""There is sudden surge in demand following a rally in palm oil prices. Companies are not able to supply as much we need this year,"" said Sougata Niyogi, a top official at Godrej Agrovet. ""The supply situation would become more comfortable next year.""

03/08/2022,"03/08/2022 (New Straits Times). Kuala Lumpur -  Kulim (Malaysia) Bhd recorded a pre-tax profit of RM433.81 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 (FY21) compared to a loss of RM316.45 million last year.
Group revenue surged 48.56 per cent to RM1.65 billion in FY21 from RM1.11 billion the previous year despite lower sales volume and yields from its plantations.
Kulim said this was achieved on higher average selling prices for crude palm oil and palm kernel, which increased by 60.66 per cent and 77.64 per cent respectively.
It was also supported by lower impairment and provision expenses compared to a year earlier, which helped the company to return to the black.
Kulim managing director Mohd Faris Adli Shukery said it stood to benefit from sky-rocketing palm product prices although it was operationally stretched by insufficient manpower.
""We were naturally pleased with our financial windfall, yet it was with even greater pleasure to see the group gradually shape up into the agriculture-focused, digitally enhanced, and sustainably run organisation that we envisage at the end of our current transformation journey,"" he said in a statement.
Under the challenging circumstances, Kulim managed to harvest 20.11 tonnes per hectare (ha) from 22.93 tonnes per ha in 2020, higher than the industry average in Johor and Peninsular Malaysia of 17.73 tonnes per ha and 16.24 tonnes per ha respectively.
In the same period, the company processed a total of 1.42 million tonnes of fresh fruit bunches and produced 295,747 tonnes of crude palm oil (CPO).
The oil extraction rate decreased to 20.83 per cent, from 21.04 per cent, yet remained higher than the industry average of 19.68 per cent for Peninsular Malaysia and 19.92 per cent for Malaysia as a whole.
Moving forward, Kulim is set to expand its foray beyond oil palm plantation into an integrated agribusiness player.
It is looking to strengthen its position in the midstream and downstream through partnerships and/or acquisitions of refineries and palm kernel crushing plants.
It is also expanding its livestock business of cattle and sheep while exploring the possibility of partnering with a dairy producer.
The company is eyeing to build a robust and thriving agri-food portfolio to contribute positively to the national food security agenda.
""Our ultimate objective is for Kulim to become a flagship company that can enhance the state and national food security agenda.
""We will seek to establish a food marketplace for smallholders, large private players and government-linked companies,"" he added.

03/08/2022,"Landed prices of palm & sunflower oils drop 14% in a month.
03/08/2022 (Financial Express) - The food ministry has called a meeting of edible oil manufacturers and trade bodies on Thursday to discuss the possibility of a further reduction in the retail prices of cooking oil amid a fall in global prices of these commodities in the last one month.
This will be the third such meetings since May. Global edible oil prices have witnessed a decline especially after Indonesia, the biggest exporter of palm oil, removed ban on shipment and easing of supply of sunflower and soy oils.
Food ministry sources told FE that the industry has to pass on the benefits to consumers. “There is still scope of further reduction in retail prices of edible oil,” an official said.
India meets 56% of its annual edible oil consumption via imports.
According to trade data, landed prices of palm oil, which has a share of more than 56% in India’s import basket, fell by more than 14% to $1,170 a tonne on July 29, from the level a month ago.
Similarly, soybean and sunflower oil prices have declined by 4% and 14%, respectively, to $1,460/tonne and $1,550/tonne, respectively, in the last one month. These two have a combined share of 43% in India’s edible oil import bill.
Last month, the department of food and public distribution, in a meeting with edible oil makers and trade associations, had asked companies to reduce prices by at least Rs 15 a litre in view of a softening of global prices.
The edible oil industry had then informed that the global prices of different edible oils have fallen by $ 300-450 per tones in the last one month, but it takes time to reflect in the retail markets. Leading manufacturers including Adani Wilmar had reduced various varieties of edible oil by Rs 5 – Rs 30 per litre subsequently.
In May, the ministry had convened the first meeting of leading edible oil makers and trade bodies and subsequently many companies announced reduction in retail prices of edible oil.
According to data from the department of consumer affairs, modal retail prices of edible oils — mustard, soya, sunflower and palm oil — have declined in the range of 5-12% in the domestic market since June 1.“Indian consumers can expect to pay less for their edible oil and falling prices will help in cooling the inflation as well,” a food ministry statement had stated last month.
The country’s annual imports are around 13-14 million tonne (MT). Around 8 MT of palm oil is imported from Indonesia and Malaysia, while other oils, such as soya and sunflower, come from Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and Russia.
The cooling of global prices which rose sharply in May 2022 when Indonesia, the world’s biggest exporter of palm oil, had imposed a ban on shipment. The supply of sunflower oil from Ukraine was disrupted because of its conflict with Russia.

This was achieved on the back of a revenue of RM5.13 billion, an increase of 19% from RM4.3 billion previously.
“The improved results were attributable to stronger revenue from the agribusiness segment led by an uptrend in crude palm oil and palm kernel prices,” JCorp said in a statement today.
The group’s wellness and healthcare segment enjoyed stronger contributions from hospital activities particularly resulting from higher inpatient and outpatient numbers, as well as from successful cost optimisation efforts across the segment.
The agribusiness segment recorded a revenue of RM1.65 billion, a significant jump of 49% from FY2020, while the wellness and healthcare segment achieved a 10% increase in revenue.
“As we progress into the age of the ‘new normal’, the JCorp 3.0 Reinvention Plan has accelerated our efforts by resetting and reimagining the group to be resilient, agile and sustainable as we future-proof this institution,” said JCorp president and chief executive Syed Mohamed Syed Ibrahim.
Reflecting the group’s strong financial health, in the first quarter of 2022, JCorp was assigned an AAA/stable rating by RAM Ratings for its RM3.5 billion Islamic Medium-Term Notes (Sukuk Wakalah) Programme.
JCorp is a value-driven organisation with total assets in excess of RM23 billion as of end-FY2021.

02/08/2022,"02/08/2022 (New Straits Times), Kuala Lumpur - Better crude palm oil (CPO) average selling price (ASP) and higher fresh fruit bunches (FFB) output are expected to drive Ta Ann Holdings Bhd's earnings in the second quarter (Q2) of 2022.
Maybank Investment Bank Bhd (Maybank IB) has forecasted Ta Ann's Q2 2022 net profit to be in the region of RM105 million to RM110 million, bringing the first half of 2022 (1H22) net profit to RM181 million to RM186 million.
The bank-backed research firm said Ta Ann is on track to achieve the firm's RM309 million full-year net profit forecast.
""Q2 2022 results will be driven by a strong oil palm plantation contribution underpinned by better CPO ASP and higher FFB output.
""Given little-to-no forward sales, we believe Ta Ann will be a prime beneficiary of the historic high CPO ASPs in Q2 2022.
""We expect Ta Ann's CPO ASP for Q2 to broadly mirror that of Malaysia Palm Oil Board's (MPOB) ASP of RM6,550 per tonne,"" it said.
While Maybank IB Research expects Ta Ann's net profit to be good, the firm cautioned that the Q2 headline profits could be dragged down by anticipated fair value (FV) loss on biological assets following the sharp decline in CPO prices towards the end of June.
The firm believes Ta Ann could reverse a large part of the RM28.5 million FV gain on biological assets recorded in Q1 2022 in Q2.
""Nonetheless, these accounting FV gains and losses are typically discounted in arriving at our core net profit analysis.
""We are maintaining our earnings forecasts, premised on CPO ASP assumptions of RM5,000 per tonne for the financial year 2022 (FY22) and RM3,400 per tonne for FY23.
""We raise Ta Ann to a Buy (from Hold) with an unchanged target price of RM4.06,"" it added.

02/08/2022,"02/08/2022 (UK Tech News) - Food tech startup Clean Food Group has raised £1.65m to develop a yeast-based lab solution to replace palm oil, a substance widely used in food manufacturing and the beauty industry but is a major driver of deforestation.
Clean Food Group has acquired intellectual property from the University of Bath for the lab alternative, where more than £4.4m was invested to commercialise the tech.
“Our dependence on palm oil comes at a great environmental cost,” said Christopher Chuck, technical advisor at Clean Food Group and professor of bioprocess engineering, Bath University.
Venture capital firm Agronomics led the £1.65m seed investment. The London-based startup said it will use the funding to develop a large-scale pilot plant, where it can make products with its yeast-based alternative.
“We’ve worked over many years to create robust palm oil alternatives that give us a real chance to cut the impact of a range of products that until now have only been possible to produce with palm oil and the deforestation, pollution and emissions that come with it,” added Chuck.
Despite the harm caused to biodiversity by chopping down palm oil trees, its prevalence in products means it is a global market valued at $50.6bn in 2021 and is expected to grow to $65.5bn by 2027.
Alex Neves, co-founder and CEO, Clean Food Group, said: “In addition to our acquisition of the intellectual property for the palm oil alternative technology and our collaboration with the University of Bath to scale the technology, we will be investing in securing regulatory approval for our palm oil alternative ingredients in multiple markets.”
Climate-conscious investors have increasingly been backing startups using novel science to develop environmentally alternatives to widely used products.
For example, Magical Mushroom Company wants to replace plastic and cardboard in packaging with the root structure of a mushroom, recently securing a £3m investment.

02/08/2022,"02/08/2022 (AHBD) - Yesterday, there were multiple stories pressuring grain and oilseed markets. The main one being that the first ship carrying Ukrainian grain left the port of Odessa. The first since 24 February 2022.
Another factor adding pressure to prices is the fear of recession still looming. This can be seen in the general fall in crude oil markets. Brent crude oil (nearby) closed yesterday at $100.03/barrel, down $9.98/barrel on Friday’s close.
All this news is creating large price volatility, driving domestic rapeseed price volatility too.  Yesterday, Paris rapeseed futures (Nov-22) dropped £34.22/t, to close at £545.10/t.
There are other developments in the vegetable oil complex that could potentially influence rapeseed prices further, and that’s palm oil.
Palm oil prices pressured
Since Indonesia lifted their palm oil export ban (on 23 May), prices have dropped. However, the government have still maintained a domestic market obligation to keep local cooking oil prices affordable. On Monday it was announced exporters will be allowed to ship nine times their domestic sales (from 01 Aug), up from seven times prior.
Since 01 June, Malaysian palm oil futures (delivered 3-months from spot) have reduced over 36.1%, based on yesterday’s close. Over this same period, Paris rapeseed futures (Nov-22) and Chicago soyabean futures (Nov-22) have dropped to a lesser degree at 19.2% & 6.9%, respectively.
The greater pressure for palm has meant that in recent weeks, the “floor” of the vegetable oil complex has been pressured.
Palm oil prices extend the edible oil price floor
As shown in the graph above, palm oil has extended its discount to other vegetable oils in recent weeks. Is there room for a fall in other vegetable oil prices too?
Prior to the war between Russia and Ukraine, we can see that elevated palm oil prices prevented any other vegetable oils dropping further.
Conclusion
The price of palm oil will continue to play its part in underpinning the vegetable oil market. If that floor reduces, it will open the opportunity for other oils to drop too.
This in turn will influence rape oil, which will impact the price you receive for your rapeseed at the farm gate.
However, there are some supportive factors that are providing some support to the vegetable oil complex current. This includes US soyabean crop development (considering hot and dry conditions) and the recent dry weather in Europe that has reduced output for EU sunseed (EU commission, Stratégie grains). These factors look to keep some support for rapeseed prices currently, though areas to watch going forward.

Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said this ceiling price was determined based on price simulation at the retailer level.
He said the setting of the ceiling price was also made based on aspects of contingent costs such as logistics, as well as retailers’ situations where they need to use up the current supply purchased at the old price.
“The decision reached through the meeting of the Special Task Force on Jihad Against Inflation yesterday, among other things, saw the mechanism for setting the ceiling price of non-subsidised bottled cooking oil determined on a monthly basis for the whole of Malaysia,” he said in a statement today.
Nanta Linggi also said the average monthly price of crude palm oil (CPO) will be determined by the Industry, Plantation, and Commodities Ministry early in the month.
“It will be followed by the announcement of the ceiling price of bottled pure cooking oil for the month which will come into effect every eighth day of the month until the seventh day of the following month,” he said.
In addition, Nanta Linggi said the prohibition on the export of unsubsidised pure cooking oil in all forms of polybag packaging was gazetted yesterday to avoid confusion among consumers and exporters.
It will also increase the effectiveness of monitoring to reduce the leakage of controlled and subsidised goods.

Tan Sri Annuar Musa said pure palm-based cooking oil in 5kg bottles were now being sold for between RM39 and RM42 each.
“Come Aug 8, the 5kg bottle will be sold at a ceiling price of RM34.70 per bottle,” he told reporters at the Parliament’s media centre here yesterday.
Annuar, who chairs the Special Task Force on Jihad Against Inflation, said the ceiling price would be determined by the average price of crude palm oil (CPO) to be announced by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) on the first day of each month.
“For example, the price of CPO per metric tonne is RM4,063 for July and this was announced by MPOB on the first day of this month. Based on the price of CPO, the calculation of the ceiling price is fixed at RM34.70 per 5kg bottle,” he said.
This method, he added, would be used to determine the ceiling price for 5kg of pure palm-based cooking oil sold by retailers for the subsequent months.
“MPOB will announce the CPO price on the first day of each month, followed by the ceiling price for the 5kg bottle a week later,” he said.
The ceiling price, he pointed out, could fluctuate depending on the CPO price the previous month.
He said engagement sessions were held with industry players who had agreed to the new ceiling price, which would provide some profit margin.
Enforcement by the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry on the new ceiling price, he said, would begin on Aug 8 to ensure compliance by retailers.
Besides engaging the food manufacturing sector, Annuar said the committee would be holding talks with the transportation and housing sectors on the steps to be taken to ease the rising cost of living and inflation.
On June 22, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that the government would maintain the RM4bil subsidy for cooking oil in 1kg packets allocated for this year.
The subsidised cooking oil is only for the 1kg polybags priced at RM2.50 each.
This was lower compared to the real market price of RM9 per bag and is meant for the consumption of those from the B40 group.
On another issue, Annuar said the committee would engage with some 80 representatives from private and public institutions of higher learning.
“The government is aware that the graduates are vulnerable to the rising cost of living and inflation, especially those on campus,” he said.

01/08/2022,"01/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Kuala Lumpur - The government on Monday (Aug 1) decided the pricing mechanism for 5kg bottles of palm cooking oil will be determined every month, with the price for August set at RM34.70 per bottle.
Special Task Force on Jihad Against Inflation Chairman Tan Sri Annuar Musa said the sale price will come into effect on Aug 8, and that the price of palm cooking oil will be set monthly based on the previous month's crude palm oil (CPO) price. The previous month's CPO price will be announced by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) on the 1st of the following month.
""MPOB will announce the price of [CPO for] the previous month, and that price will be the benchmark to determine the retail price of pure palm cooking oil sold without subsidy.
""MPOB has informed that the average price of CPO for July was at RM4,063 per metric ton. Based on that price, the selling price of cooking oil in 5kg bottles [will] be set at RM34.70 [for August],"" he said at a press conference after chairing the Special Task Force on Jihad Against Inflation at the Parliament building on Monday (Aug 1).
The price of RM34.70 set for 5kg bottles of cooking oil is only for Peninsular Malaysia, excluding Sabah and Sarawak. A table will also be announced to include the price for 3kg bottles.
Regarding how the price mechanism works, Annuar noted that a calculation method will be determined by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs after MPOB declares the monthly CPO price.
According to Annuar, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs and industry players have negotiated a pricing schedule that will ensure industry players are still able to make sufficient profit margins under the monthly pricing mechanism.
He expects the same method of determining the ceiling price of non-subsidised cooking oil to be maintained in the coming months.
Annuar, who is also Communications and Multimedia Minister, added that enforcement in stores at the retail level shall begin seven days from the date it is announced.
""Starting from Aug 8, 5kg cooking oil [bottles,] currently sold at a price of approximately RM39 to RM42, should be sold at a maximum price of RM34.70.
""Retail outlets will have [a grace period of one week] to comply with the new maximum pricing. They can sell lower but the maximum price for 5kg cooking oil [bottles] must not be more than RM34.70,"" he said.
According to the Ketereh Member of Parliament, MPOB has made the commitment to announce the average CPO price for the previous month and from that price, the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs will calculate the maximum control price for non-subsidised cooking oil.
""This method is to make sure that when CPO price goes up, [we] won't raise the cooking oil price too quickly, and when the CPO price goes down, [we] won't be too slow to lower the cooking oil price.
""This happened in the past. So with this method agreed upon by the industry, every increase or decrease in the CPO price must be reflected in the retail price as soon as possible, in this case one month after the official price is announced,"" he said.
Since July 1, Putrajaya has ceased subsidies for palm cooking oil of 2kg, 3kg and 5kg bottles. However, the government has continued to subsidise 1kg cooking oil packs, which are packaged in polybags and priced at RM2.50 each.

01/08/2022,"01/08/2022 (The Edge Markets), Jakarta - Indonesia will retain its domestic sales requirement for palm oil to keep local cooking oil prices affordable, a senior official told Reuters on Monday (Aug 1), noting that a quota for export shipments would be relaxed further.
Palm oil industry participants have sought the removal of the so-called Domestic Market Requirement (DMO) under which exporters must sell a portion of production locally before being granted export permits.
To reduce high palm oil stocks, the government from Monday will allow exporters to ship nine times the amount sold locally under the DMO, up from seven times previously, Septian Hario Seto, a deputy coordinating minister for maritime and investment affairs, said in an interview.
The world's biggest palm oil producer implemented the DMO scheme to ensure local cooking oil supplies after ending a palm oil export ban on May 23.
However, the ban and DMO have created an inventory glut that has slashed prices of palm oil fruit for farmers.
""We are trying to maintain a balance that is quite complicated to achieve,"" said Seto.
""We want the cooking oil price at 14,000 rupiah (US$0.9415 or about RM4.19) per litre, we want smooth export flows, while also lifting farmers' palm oil fruit prices,"" he said.
Bulk cooking oil derived from palm oil averaged about 18,000 rupiah per litre in April and now costs about 14,400 rupiah.
The trade minister said last month he would consider removing the DMO if given assurances from palm oil producers that they would maintain enough supply for domestic demand.
""We want to be consistent with our policy, there will be no change (on DMO),"" Seto said, adding top ministers reached that conclusion after reviewing the request.
""We have to reduce stocks gradually, we can't do it in one go because it will hurt (global) prices.""
Indonesia's export resumption and speculation of a DMO removal, plus higher output in rival Malaysia, have helped drive down benchmark Malaysian palm oil futures, which lost nearly 32% in June and July.
The chairman of Indonesia Palm Oil Association, Joko Supriyono, at an industry conference said the DMO was not the most effective policy to balance supply to export and domestic markets.
He said the government should maintain cooking oil supply for low-income consumers, who typically use 2.5 million tonnes per year, through direct subsidy.
""We must pick an instrument that can secure 2.5 million tonnes without sacrificing our exports that reach around 35 million tonnes per year,"" he said.

01/08/2022,"01/08/2022 (Malay Mail) - The Special Task Force on Jihad Against Inflation today announced a new system in which the maximum price for pure palm cooking oil will be announced on the first of every month, with enforcement to follow seven days later, said its chairman Tan Sri Annuar Musa.
The maximum price for pure palm cooking oil, which is not covered by subsidies, is set based on the average prices of the previous month, with this month’s price for a five-kilogramme bottle being RM34.70, said the communications and multimedia minister during a press conference in Parliament.
“The price is set monthly based on the price of crude palm oil (CPO) which will be announced by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) on the first of every month,” he said.
Enforcement of the maximum price set on the first of every month will follow on the eighth of the month, with retailers being given a week of grace to adjust prices, he explained.
The prices for other weights of pure palm cooking oil will follow the announcement in a schedule, he said.
He also said the reason for this system is so that the price of pure palm cooking oil will not rise too quickly when prices go up, but also so prices will not go down too slowly when prices decrease.
Punishment for not following the maximum price set for the month will be according to existing laws, he said.

01/08/2022,"01/08/2022 (The Malaysian Reserve) - KULIM (M) Bhd recorded its profit before tax and zakat in the financial year Dec 31, 2021 (FY21) of RM433.81 million from a loss of RM316.45 million in the previous year.
The group said its FY21 result was driven by palm oil prices and its improved operational efficiencies.
Its revenue surged by 48.56% to RM1.65 billion from RM1.11 billion previously despite lower sales volumes and yields from its plantations.
“This was achieved on higher average selling prices for crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel, which increased by 60.66% and 77.64% respectively,” it said in a statement today.
Kulim, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johor Corp Bhd also saw its FY21 return to the black due to lower impairment and provision expenses compared to a year earlier.
“Under the circumstances, Kulim still managed to harvest 20.11 metric tonnes per ha (MT/ha) from 22.93 MT/ha in 2020, which was higher than the industry average in Johor and Peninsular Malaysia of 17.73 MT/ha and 16.24 MT/ha respectively,” it noted.
In the same period, the group processed a total of 1.42 million MT of fresh fruit bunches and produced 295,747 MT of CPO.
Its oil extraction rate fell 20.83% versus 21.04%, however, it remained higher than the industry average of 19.68% for Peninsular Malaysia and 19.92% for Malaysia as a whole.
Kulim MD Mohd Faris Adli Shukery said the group FY21 is one of its best financial results to date despite sub-optimum production and yield as well as insufficient manpower.
“We were naturally pleased with our financial windfall, yet it was with even greater pleasure to see the group gradually shape up into the agriculture-focused, digitally enhanced and sustainably run organisation that we envisage at the end of our current transformation journey,” he said.
Moving forward, Kulim is now set to expand its foray beyond oil palm plantation into an integrated agribusiness player.
The group is looking to strengthen its position in the midstream and downstream through partnerships and/or acquisitions of refineries and palm kernel crushing plants.
It is also expanding its livestock business of cattle and sheep while exploring the possibility of partnering with a dairy producer.
Notably, Kulim is looking at building a robust and thriving agri-food portfolio to contribute positively to the national food security agenda.
“Our ultimate objective is for Kulim to become a flagship company that can enhance the state and national food security agenda.
“We will seek to establish a food marketplace for smallholders, large private players and government-linked companies,” he further said.
Kulim’s new business segment, agro-farming includes intensive farming and mono-crop to supply quality vegetables and fruit for the Malaysian market via adopting IR4.0 technology to further enhance crop management while leveraging automation to reduce labour requirements.
Meanwhile, the group is rolling out a structured environmental, social and governance framework which will align its sustainability initiatives with its vision, strategy and goals.
“Kulim is targeting to halve its carbon footprint by 2025 and has invested in expanding its renewable energy infrastructure in biogas plants that have helped cut the group’s methane emissions by 90%,” it added.
This is in line with the group’s business direction to expand its potential in green business which is expected to contribute positively to its earnings, as a new income stream.

31/07/2022,"31/07/2022 (The Sun Daily), Petaling Jaya - Kulim (Malaysia) Bhd reported its best-ever financial results in 2021 on record palm oil prices and improved operational efficiencies from its ongoing transformation programme to become a leading agribusiness company.
On the back of another challenging year arising from the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic and other external factors, Kulim turned in a group pre-tax profit of RM433.81 million for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2021, reversing the previous period’s loss of RM316.45 million.

29/07/2022,"29/07/2022 (The Star Online), Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia is ready to assist Indonesia in dealing with its high palm oil inventories, says Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin.
The Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister said a working committee has been set up to assist Indonesia - the world’s biggest palm oil producer - in reducing its stock.
""As members of the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC), we have to help each other,” she said at the closing ceremony of the Malaysia International Agricommodity Expo and Summit (MIACES) 2022 on Thursday (July 28) night.
According to news reports, Indonesia’s palm oil exports have not gone back to normal levels despite the lifting of its export ban on May 23, as companies are required to show proof of their domestic sales before they can secure their export permits - a move which led to increasing stocks, and subsequently, falling prices.

30/07/2022,"30/07/2022 (The Star Online), Kuala Lumpur - The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives is projected to extend its uptrend next week after a three-day winning streak on optimism over the outlook for oil and vegetable oils.
Palm oil trader David Ng expects futures prices to move between RM3,700 and RM4,500 per tonne next week.
Market sentiment was lifted by the current heat wave in the United States (US), which had affected soybean output.
It was reported that the heat wave in the Pacific Northwest is expected to last longer than initially predicted with a higher chance for the US Department of Agriculture to end up cutting 2022 soybean yield forecasts.
This, in turn, may support the demand for CPO, a cheaper oil compared to soybean oil.
However, Ng reckons that the market may see some pressure from Indonesia's palm oil supply glut.
Indonesia is trying to clear their high stock by waiving its export levy effective July 15 to Aug 31.
Singapore-based Palm Oil Analytics owner and co-founder Dr Sathia Varqa said that with the expected bearish July supply and demand estimates to be released next week, prices may fall from the highs recorded on Friday.
The CPO futures rose to a three-week high yesterday amid rising prices of oil and competing soyabean and rapeseed oils boosted demand.
For the trading week just ended, Malaysian CPO futures were mostly higher.
On a Friday-to-Friday basis, spot month August 2022 jumped RM323 to RM4,030 a tonne, September 2022 was RM258 higher at RM3,959 a tonne and October 2022 was up RM237 to RM3,957 a tonne.

31/07/2022,"31/07/2022 (The Star Online), Alor Gajah - Negotiations are being held with palm oil industry players to devise the best formula to quickly reduce supply prices.
Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry secretary-general Datuk Azman Mohd Yusof said the price of cooking palm oil depends on the world market, which often sees fluctuations.
“We are in negotiation with the industry to determine a formula that could lower (the price of cooking palm oil) a little faster, but it has to be reasonable as they also want to ensure that the operating costs will not affect them.
“The industry has actually agreed to help the government by taking into account the burden faced by the people to ensure that the price (of cooking palm oil) also goes down like the price in the world market,” Bernama reported him as telling the media after he inspected a factory producing toys yesterday.
Also present was state unity, information, human resources and consumer affairs committee chairman Ngwe Hee Sem.
Azman said that after the world palm oil price dropped recently, there are industry players who have taken the initiative to slash the price of non-subsidised bottled palm cooking oil to be sold in the market.
“Some of the unsubsidised bottled palm cooking oil has dropped to RM29.

31/07/2022,"31/07/2022 (New Straits Times), Kuala Lumpur - The government needs to allocate more funding under Budget 2023 for a more concerted effort towards environmental preservation.
Plantation Industries and Commodities (MPIC) Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin said this was also in line with Malaysia's commitment to realising targets set under the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
""The recent death of an oil palm plantation worker trampled by a wild elephant in Temerloh was a tragic incident. MPIC wishes to extend our deepest condolences to the victim's family.
""Over the years, MPIC, through various agencies like the Malaysian Palm Oil Green Conservation Foundation (MPOGCF), has undertaken numerous measures to ensure sustainable growth for the industry.
""This includes setting up the Borneo Elephant Wildlife Sanctuary to address human-elephant conflict and create a controlled public access sanctuary to better understand and care for these animals,"" she said in a statement today.
MPOGCF has also started a programme to plant elephant grass species to encourage the animals to utilise the wildlife corridors and eventually help mitigate human-elephant conflicts.
MPIC also supports the Heart of Borneo Initiative. A joint Declaration initiated this uniquely government-led and NGO supported programme by the governments of Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia in 2007.
The programme aims to conserve the biodiversity of the Heart of Borneo for the benefit of the people who rely upon it through a network of protected areas, sustainable management of forests, and other sustainable land uses.
""These efforts demonstrate the government's commitment to preserving our rich biodiversity.
""Malaysia has agreed to support and participate in the Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use and the Global Methane Pledge at the 26th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP-26) held in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, in November 2021.
""Malaysia's participation, along with 141 other countries, in this declaration is in line with the country's Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use to continue maintaining at least 50 percent of the country's land area under forest cover and to strengthen its commitment in conservation and sustainable management of forests and other ecosystems and land use including agriculture,"" she said.
Such efforts, said Zuraida, also repudiate criticisms, especially from the West, that Malaysia has been breaching global environmental standards for commercial considerations.
""On my part, the mnistry and I have constantly refuted these distorted views, especially during my trade missions abroad, in line with the ""The Global Movement to Champion the Goodness of Palm Oil"" campaign,"" she added.
